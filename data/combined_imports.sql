(a) Pre-recharge conditions: water moves slowly through the unsaturated zone, ground-water moves through the bedrock adjacent to and underlying the floodplain aquifer (alluvium), and chemically homogeneous ground water fills the saturated portion of the alluvium. (b) Recharge conditions: precipitation enters the bedrock aquifer(s) rapidly, probably through fractures. The newly recharged water displaces ‘resident’ ground water in the bedrock into the alluvium, causing a relatively rapid rise in water table because of injection of more sulfate-rich water (vertical bars) from the bedrock into the base of the alluvium. The rise in water table entrains high-nitrate water (slanted bars) in the inundated part of the unsaturated zone. Unsaturated-zone water flow continues downward, but is still slow, because low hydraulic conductivity of the alluvium prevents rapid recharge. Unsaturated zone air is pushed upward out of the ground, also, as the alluvium water table rises. (c) Early post-recharge: when recharge to the bedrock ceases, the water table begins to fall as the water in the alluvium drains to the creek.

Piston-type flow may occur within serpertinized fractured macropores (i.e., faults) producing freshwater springs if the system is open in respect to CO2 (2). These flow paths appear to be relatively shallow. Deep groundwater flow feeds the creek during the dry season (4). Base flow discharge is a function of storage, where a corresponds to the characteristic recession time scale (presumably low due to high evapotranspiration). Hydraulic parameters such as conductivity (K), drainage porosity (f), and aquifer thickness (D) are unknown. If the system responds as a linear reservoir, then b = 1. Deep groundwater flow may dilute the signature of active serpentinizing (3). However, active serpentinizing flow paths could also emerge as hyperalkaline springs probably with an exponential-piston flow distribution due to the constant structural changes (6). Hyperalkaline fluids form riparian pools coated by a CaCO3 supernatant film where travertine terraces are evident and potential heterotrophic microbial methanogenesis may also occur (7 and 8). The hyperalkaline fluids are characterized by high pH, Ca, and low Mg. The fluids mix with receiving stream waters at low rates and volumes, thus, dilution occurs rapidly (9). As measured in the Río Murciélago watershed methane emanations (24.3% v/v) occur at the streambed (5). Other hydrocarbons may be produced during the serpentinization process.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The routing of substantial amounts of runoff through shallow organic rich soils is common to this study and the studies referenced here. However, unlike Renzetti et al. (1992), who identified the predominant subsurface flow path as being along the bedrock-soil interface, our results indicate that subsurface runoff pathways are strongly influenced by the underlying bedrock microtopography and the predominant subsurface flow path may occur through surface organic LFH soils rather than through deeper mineral soils. The hydrographic analysis of the linked subbasin runoff response provides an indication of the complexity of interactions between the hydrological contributing area and flow pathways that occur within this landscape. Under dry antecedent conditions the initial runoff will be generated as Horton overland flow from lichen-covered bedrock surfaces. Runoff from forest areas will begin later in the event, first as subsurface stormflow and, if the event is large enough, as saturation overland flow. Under wet antecedent conditions the time lag is reduced and the hydrological contributing areas expand rapidly to include forested areas and lichen-bedrock areas draining into the soil deposits. Peak runoff from this landscape occurs when forest soil deposits become saturated, maximizing the potential hydrological contributing area. Runoff during the recession limb of the storm hydrograph occurs almost entirely as subsurface stormflow from forested areas over a prolonged time period. The temporal changes in both runoff pathway and hydrological contributing area and the proportion of pre-event water associated with each hydrological pathway will result in temporal variations in runoff water quality in this landscape (Allan et al., submitted). Exposed lichen-covered granitic surfaces comprise most of the surface area within each of the catchments examined. This results in most of the runoff being generated as Horton overland flow. However, the occurrence of the forest soil deposits in bedrock depressions results in the routing of a considerable portion of the runoff generated as Horton overland flow through the forest soil deposits as subsurface stormflow and subsequently as return flow. Therefore, the potential modification of precipitation chemistry by the isolated forest stands in this landscape is considerable. The forested soil deposits also serve to delay and reduce runoff from these systems by storing runoff from upslope bedrock areas. The prolonged drainage from forest soils after rain and snowmelt periods, although quantitatively minor, is important to the maintenance of the vegetative community established on the dry granitic outcrops.

The 520 ha C2 reference watershed is isolated and free of any human intervention. The vegetation in CPCRW is dominated by birch and aspen on the south-facing slopes and black spruce forests on the north-facing slopes. The climate is typically continental with warm summers and cold winters. The CPCRW is unique among the watersheds in this cross-site comparison because it is underlain by discontinuous permafrost. The permafrost distribution within the watershed exerts a strong influence over hydrological patterns (Jones and Rinehart, 2010). Studies show that as the areal extent of permafrost increases, peak discharge increases, baseflow decreases and response to precipitation events increases (Bolton et al., 2004). The C2 watershed was chosen as a reference watershed because it is underlain by only about 3% permafrost compared with the adjacent C3 and C4 watersheds which are underlain by 53% and 19%, respectively.\nTotal mean precipitation in the C2 watershed is 412 mm, with mean snowfall and rainfall being 130 mm and 280 mm, respectively (Bolton et al., 2004). Annual maximum snow depth averages 750 mm with a snow water equivalent of 110 mm. Of the total precipitation, nearly 20% becomes streamflow while evapotranspiration makes up over 75% (Bolton et al., 2004). About 35% of the total precipitation falls as snow between October and April. Snowfall peaks around January while rainfall peaks around July. The spatial distribution of rainfall amount is influenced by elevation. The relatively flat FDC for the C2 watershed (Plates 11 and 12, Table 14.2) may be attributed to the relatively well-drained soils that allow infiltration to deeper subsurface reservoirs. Runoff is generated only when the infiltration capacity is met. Streamflow in the watershed is generated by shallow subsurface storm runoff from permafrost-dominated areas, but steady groundwater baseflows with the highest Q90 /Q50 of all the sites (Table 14.2) are produced from permafrost-free areas such as C2. Spring snowmelt is usually the major hydrological event of the year, although the annual peak flow usually occurs during summer rainstorm events, as the highest rainfall intensities are greater than the maximum snowmelt rate on a daily timescale (Kane and Hinzman, 2004). It may be noted from Fig. 14.2 that the mean monthly streamflow of C2 is relatively even over the months of April through October.

Initially, the entire 473 ha NF watershed served as the reference watershed, but after portions were logged in 1985, three NF sub-watersheds (16 to 39 ha) were designated as long-term reference watersheds. Bedrock is marine sandstone and shale of the Franciscan Complex. Most soils are 1–2 m deep loams and clay-loams and underlain by saprolite at depths of 3–8 m near ridgetops. Only about one-fifth of the 4.6 km/km2 drainage density supports perennial streamflow. Timber production has been the major land use, and evidence of 19th century logging and the impacts of this legacy persist. Snow is hydrologically insignificant and 95% of rainfall occurs in October–April. Fog occurs on about one-third of days in June–September, reducing summer transpiration (Keppeler, 2007). The marine influence ensures that summer air temperatures rarely exceed 20°C and winter minimums seldom drop below 0°C. Stream runoff is about half of the average annual rainfall (Reid and Lewis, 2009). Transpiration and canopy evaporation account for nearly equal portions of the remainder (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume). Actual evapotranspiration is limited by soil moisture deficits in May–September. Analysis of climate-related trends suggests that autumn rainfall and streamflow have declined, but with no change in annual totals. The FDC for CCEW spans a wide range of streamflow compared with most of the other USDA-EFR sites (Plates 11 and 12) due to the strong seasonal pattern of large, episodic winter rain events that typically produce multiple, short-duration peak flows while extended summer droughts result in a long, slow recession for about half the year (Fig. 14.2). Summer streamflow is generated primarily from groundwater, and by autumn about 300 mm of precipitation is needed to mitigate moisture deficits sufficiently to generate stormflow. Stormflow (total flow based on difference between initial discharge at start of runoff and the discharge at 3 days following the cessation of the rainfall event) comprises about two-thirds of annual runoff (Reid and Lewis, 2009). Infiltration is rapid on uncompacted soils and vertical throughflow dominates near the surface. A deeper clay-rich argillic horizon can impede downward flow and generate lateral subsurface flow, although preferential flow through interconnected soil macropores limits pore-pressure increases and the extent of this perched flow. Perennial and intermittent soil pipes occur in the upper 2 m of the regolith and are frequently encountered near channel heads. When transient groundwater tables rise to the elevation of these pipes, they rapidly transmit subsurface flow to channels, mitigating pore-pressure increases upslope (Keppeler and Brown, 1998). Saturation-excess overland (return) flow is limited, but can occur on valley bottoms during large storms.', '14.2.2', '227', 'Caspar Creek Experimental Watershed (CCEW), reference watershed North Fork (NF), California', 1, '2', 'Vegetation described', 'Soil described', 'Geological types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 135, 35, 143, 1, 1, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The CHL is located in western North Carolina (Fig. 14.1) and is representative of southern Appalachian mixed deciduous hardwoods. The 13 ha WS18 watershed was last selectively harvested in the early 1920s prior to the establishment of the CHL (Douglass and Hoover, 1988). Although the watershed has not been actively managed for more than 80 years, there have been several natural disturbances that have altered forest structure and species composition, including Chestnut blight fungus (Endothia parasitica) in the 1920s–1930s, drought in the 1980s and 2000s, Hurricane Opal in 1995, and hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) defoliation from 2002 to the present (Boring et al., 2014). Precipitation in WS18 averages 2010 mm/year; it is highest in the late winter months and lowest in the autumn, although a disproportionate amount of large events associated with tropical storms occurs during this season. Less than 10% of precipitation occurs as snow. The variability in precipitation has been increasing over time resulting in more frequent extremely wet years and extremely dry years, while annual average air temperature has been increasing by 0.5°C/decade since 1981 (Laseter et al., 2012). Annual precipitation in WS18 is approximately equally partitioned into streamflow (49.6%) and evapotranspiration (50.4%). During the growing season, transpiration accounts for 55% of total evapotranspiration with evaporation from canopy interception making up the balance, approximately 15% of precipitation (Ford et al., 2011). Streamflow is typically highest in March–April and lowest in September–October but never ceases, even during extreme drought. Seasonal patterns in streamflow reflect the combined effects of the seasonality in precipitation and evapotranspiration (Fig. 14.2). Baseflows are relatively high, producing the third largest Q90/Q50 ratio among sites (Table 14.2). Baseflows are sustained by lateral movement of water through deep unsaturated soil (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume), driven by large hydraulic gradients induced by steep slopes (Hewlett and Hibbert, 1963). On average, approximately 5% of annual precipitation (9% of annual streamflow) is discharged as stormflow (Swift et al., 1988). Stormflow originates primarily from small portions of the watershed located adjacent to the stream in coves and in riparian zones where the water table may be near the surface (Hewlett and Hibbert, 1967). Shallow lateral subsurface discharge from upslope landscape positions to streams can also contribute to stormflow where large soil macropores exist. Overland flow is extremely rare or non-existent because of the presence of well-developed forest floors and subsurface macropores.', '14.2.3', '227', 'Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory (CHL), reference watershed WS18, North Carolina', 1, '1', 'Vegetation described', 'N', 'N', 'Slopes described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 136, 47, 143, 1, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The FnEF is located in eastern West Virginia (Fig. 14.1) and is representative of the ‘unmanaged’ forests of the central Appalachian region. The 39 ha WS4 watershed is forested with an approximately 100-year-old stand of mixed deciduous hardwoods. The bedrock is acidic sandstone and shale. Depth to bedrock is generally less than 1 m and the topography is steep. Precipitation is distributed evenly throughout the year and averages 1458 mm. Although snow is common in winter, snowpack generally lasts no more than a few weeks; snow contributes approximately 14% on average of precipitation (Adams et al., 1994). Large rainfall events can occur during extra-tropical hurricanes in the summer and autumn, but about half of the largest storms have occurred during the dormant season (1 November–30 April), when streams are most responsive to rainfall because evapotranspiration losses are low (Fig. 14.2). The stream channel is intermittent near the top of the watershed. Streamflow may cease during the late summer and early autumn (about 10% of daily flows), in response to high evapotranspirative demand and low precipitation. Although baseflow contributes relatively little to Q90/Q50 (Table 14.2), it dominates stream discharge in WS4. Most discharge occurs during the dormant season (Fig. 14.2) due to greater precipitation and decreased evapotranspirative demand from deciduous forests. Baseflow is sustained by lateral subsurface flow to channels; DeWalle et al. (1997) characterized the mean transit time for baseflow on WS4 as 1.4–1.6 years, which suggests a dominance of slow movement through the soil matrix. The water balance on WS4 was well quantified by Patric (1973) with runoff accounting for about 40% of precipitation, 27% of the balance being lost through transpiration and about 16% to canopy evaporation. Seasonal differences in losses from canopy interception due to leaf development and leaf drop were detected. Stormflow discharge is fairly flashy (Plates 11 and 12), with the storm hydrograph responding rapidly to storm precipitation inputs and then returning quickly to baseflow conditions, and streamflow generation occurs via saturation excess flow. Stormflow discharge typically occurs less than 15% of the time. There is little to no infiltration-excess overland flow even during the largest storms because of the high infiltration capacity of an intact forest floor.', '14.2.4', '228', 'Fernow Experimental Forest (FnEF), reference watershed WS4, West Virginia', 1, '3', 'Vegetation described', 'Soil described', 'Geological types described', 'Slopes described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 137, 66, 143, 1, 1, 2),

It spans the subalpine to alpine zone; a zone that is characterized by relatively low temperatures and moderate precipitation (Love, 1960). The area is dominated by Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir on higher-elevation and shaded slopes, lodgepole pine on lower-elevation sunny slopes and alpine tundra above the treeline. The 803 ha ESL watershed has received no significant treatment in over 90 years (Retzer, 1962). Precipitation is dominated heavily by snowfall (about 75%) from October through May (Alexander et al., 1985) and runoff is dominated by snowmelt (about 90%) from May through August (Fig. 14.2). Significant summertime convective rainfall events may also temporarily increase flow. The main stem is perennial but baseflow is low, stable and unmeasured during the winter months due to logistical difficulties of stream measurements in winter. The runoff coefficient for annual flow is about 45% with significant wintertime sublimation losses from the canopy and summertime evapotranspiration. Summertime rainfall is primarily used on site by vegetation, with high evaporative losses due to dry air masses and wind. High-elevation stream reaches are intermittent with spring and summertime flows fed by snowmelt (Fig. 14.2). The hydrological regime is dominated by a typical seasonal snowmelt hydrograph with a rapid rising limb in May and June, followed by a long recession, returning to baseflow (second largest Q90/Q50 , Table 14.2) in August (Alexander et al., 1985; Troendle and King, 1985). Extensive spring networks feed the drainage systems as the annual snowmelt pulse moves through the basin (Retzer, 1962). Rainfall events punctuate the snowmelt hydrograph, but contribute insignificant amounts to the annual runoff. Infiltration-excess overland flow is rare, but may occur under the snowpack during the melt season when frozen ground impedes infiltration. Saturation-excess overland flow is extremely rare as infiltration rates for the porous soils and glacial till typically exceed maximum rainfall and snowmelt rates (Retzer, 1962). The ESL represents the highest elevation range, largest snowpack and largest watershed of this cross-site comparison. Maximum snowmelt rates are limited by incoming energy and can never reach extreme rainfall rates. Rain-on-snow flood events can alter flow statistics, but are rare in this portion of the Rockies.

Watershed 2 (WS02) is 60 ha and the geology is dominated by bedrock of volcanic origin. Stream channels are steep and confined with unsorted sediment dominated by cobbles and boulders, with patches of silt and exposed bedrock. Shallow hillslope soils (generally less than 1 m deep) are loam and clay loam. Stone content ranges from 35 to 80%, increasing on south-facing slopes. The steep hillslopes in WS02 are dominated by 500- to 550-year-old Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga mensiesii) forests with western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and western red cedar (Thuja plicata) (Rothacher et al., 1967). The canopy is greater than 60 m tall. The climate is continental with cold winters and cool, short, dry summers. Annual precipitation averages 2300 mm, falling primarily as rain between  November and April and with occasional snow at higher elevations. Soil temperatures remain above freezing. The annual hydrograph in WS02 has a strong seasonal pattern with a high winter baseflow and frequent autumn, winter and spring stormflows in contrast to very low flows in summer (Fig. 14.3). Approximately 57% of the precipitation is streamflow (Post and Jones, 2001). Baseflow accounts for only 43% of the discharge (Q90/Q50 = 0.126) (Table 14.2) whereas quickflow comprises the remainder (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume). McGuire et al. (2005) estimated that mean baseflow residence time for WS02, based on δO18 of water, was approximately 2.2 years. They suggested that topography and steepness may be exerting greater control on residence times than watershed area. Although there are no detectable trends in streamflow from 1987 to 2007, in more recent time periods (1996–2007) slight decreasing trends have been observed (Argerich et al., 2013). The relatively steep FDC for WS02 (Plates 11 and 12) has been attributed to highly permeable soils and strong seasonal precipitation patterns. Fast percolation rates, typically greater than 0.12 m/h, are influenced by high stone content and large pore spaces (Rothacher et al., 1967).

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The HBEF is located in New Hampshire (Fig. 14.1) and is representative of mature northern hardwood stands. Vegetation at W3 is composed mainly of sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis). The 42 ha watershed is mostly second growth and much of the HBEF was harvested in the 1910s (Table 14.1). Additional salvage harvesting occurred at the HBEF following the Great New England Hurricane of 1938. More recently, trees incurred some damage during the North American Ice Storm of 1998, with no apparent impact on annual runoff. The climate at the HBEF is cool and humid. On average, W3 receives 1350 mm of precipitation annually, which is distributed evenly throughout the year. Precipitation has increased by 25% during the record period, which is consistent with broader regional trends (Brown et al., 2010). Approximately one-third of precipitation falls as snow (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume) and a snowpack generally persists from late December until mid-April. Soil frost forms during winter two out of every three years with an average annual maximum depth of 6 cm. The annual hydrograph shows a strong seasonal pattern with a peak during snowmelt runoff. Despite the higher flow during spring, floods can occur at any time of year when soil water deficits are reduced (Fig. 14.2). An increasing trend in precipitation has resulted in increasing trends in the magnitude of both low and high streamflows (Campbell et al., 2011). Approximately 64% of the precipitation that falls on the watershed becomes streamflow, with evapotranspiration comprising the remainder. Slight, but statistically significant declines in evapotranspiration have occurred in W3 (14% over 56 years) for reasons that are unknown. This decline appears to be due to local influences since similar trends are not consistently found at a larger regional scale. The relatively steep FCD for W3 (Plates 11 and 12) has traditionally been attributed to coarse, well-drained soils and mountainous topography that produce a flashy runoff response. Overland flow is also minimal because of the high infiltration capacity of the forest floor. In recent years, a more complete understanding of complex flow generation processes at the site has emerged. Data from a network of wells in W3 have revealed an intermittent, discontinuous water table (Detty and McGuire, 2010a; Gannon et al., 2014; Gillin et al., 2015). Stormflow generation is the result of lateral subsurface flow in the solum. Under some soil moisture conditions, small changes in groundwater can produce large changes in runoff, suggesting a threshold response that is related to flowpaths and soil transmissivity (Detty and McGuire, 2010b; Gannon et al., 2014). During low flows, only the near-stream zone is consistently hydrologically connected to the stream network. As the watershed wets up, more distal, previously isolated portions of the water table become hydrologically connected.', '14.2.7', '229', 'Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), reference watershed W3, New Hampshire', 1, '1', 'Vegetation described', 'N', 'N', 'Slopes described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 140, 95, 143, 1, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The MEF is located along the southern fringe of the boreal biome, in northern Minnesota (Fig. 14.1). The landscape includes uplands, peatlands, lakes and streams. Unlike mountainous research watersheds, streamflow typically is not bedrock controlled in the western lakes section where outwash sands, some >50 m deep, form large aquifers (Verry et al., 2011).  Aquifer–peatland connectivity varies between two peatland types: bogs and fens (Bay, 1967). In watersheds with either type, streamflow may originate from precipitation and flow along near-surface and shallow surface flowpaths in upland mineral soils (Verry et al., 2011). Bog watersheds may be perched due to loamy clay tills that retard the vertical flow of water from soils to the outwash aquifer (Verry et al., 2011). In fen watersheds, most streamflow, which may exceed streamflow from bogs by orders of magnitude during low flow, originates as discharge from aquifers and is perennial (Bay, 1967). The 10 ha S2 study watershed, with a bog (33% of the area), has low topographic relief (Table 14.1) with upland mineral soils that drain through peatland margins to an intermittent stream. Eleven to 33% of annual precipitation (456–981 mm) occurs as streamflow and 5–17% recharges the underlying aquifer (Nichols and Verry, 2001) (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume). Calculated evapotranspiration (precipitation – streamflow – recharge) has been 372–605 mm/year. Nine of the ten highest daily streamflows have occurred during rainfall–runoff events, not snowmelt or rain-on-snow events. Periods of no streamflow occur during any month and there has been no flow during 38% of the record (Plates 11 and 12), consistent with the zero value of Q90/Q50 (Table 14.2). Although most of the S2 area is uplands, most of the annual water budget (58%) comes from direct precipitation on the peatland (Verry et al., 2011). If the water table is >5–10 cm below the peatland surface, streamflow ceases and that storage must be replenished before resumption. Rainfall amount during summer exceeds snow water equivalents during winter and stormflows recess rapidly to no flow due to evapotranspiration. Melt from snow accumulation (November/December to March/April) results in several weeks of high flows (Sebestyen et al., 2011) (Fig. 14.2). Winter and spring frost in upland soils, exceeding 50 cm, prevents infiltration (Verry et al., 2011). Snowmelt waters flow overland until soils thaw in the spring, after which flow mostly occurs in the shallow subsurface through sandy loams above loamy clay horizons (Verry et al., 2011). Subsurface flow may persist for weeks until the upland deciduous forest begins transpiring. During large summer rainfall events, subsurface flow may last for several hours, but rarely longer.', '14.2.8', '230', 'Marcell Experimental Forest (MEF), reference watershed S2, Minnesota', 1, '1', 'Vegetation described', 'Soil described', 'N', 'Slopes described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 141, 141, 143, 1, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The 25 ha watershed at SDEF is located in southern California (Fig. 14.1) and is representative of the chaparral forests of the US Southwest. Chaparral forest is a dense, drought-tolerant shrubland with a closed canopy some 3–5 m in height. Chaparral is a fire-prone ecosystem and wildfires have burned the SDEF about every 40 years. Regional hydrology is controlled by climate and geology: cool, wet winters followed by long summer droughts; and ongoing tectonic uplift that has produced steep topography and exposed fractured crystalline basement rocks that weather to thin, coarse-textured, azonal soils (Dunn et al., 1988) (Table 14.1). Precipitation falls almost exclusively as rain from winter frontal storms and rare summer thunderstorms. Nearly 90% of the annual rainfall occurs between December and April with the most runoff in February (Fig. 14.2). Streamflow accounts for only roughly 11% of the rainfall, with the remainder apportioned to evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge. Groundwater dynamics on the SDEF are virtually unknown, rendering the closure of any water balance exercise moot. However, groundwater recharge is potentially large through the fractured substrate, reducing any calculated value of actual evapotranspiration. Soil moisture is at or below the wilting point by the end of the summer and the drought-adapted plants likely get their water from fractures in the bedrock. Stream runoff is generated by saturation excess flow in riparian zones, presumably as shallow throughflow moves laterally through the coarse soil mantle (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume). Infiltration-excess overland flow on hillside slopes is rare and occurs only during the most intense rainstorms, reflecting the high infiltration rates of the soil and percolation into bedrock. However, after wildfire, with the combustion of the canopy and surface litter layer as well as changes in soil properties (bulk density and water repellency), hillslope hydrology shifts to pervasive overland flow after saturation of the very thin surface wettable layer (Rice, 1974; DeBano, 1981). Water that formerly slowly flowed by subsurface pathways now moves quickly into the stream channels, increasing runoff for comparable storms by up to four orders of magnitude over pre-fire levels (Wohlgemuth, 2016).

The 155 ha WS80 watershed is covered with a pine/mixed hardwood forest (Table 14.1), which has been undisturbed by management activities since 1936, but was heavily affected by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 that damaged >80% of the forest canopy (Hook et al., 1991).Seasonally, the winter is generally wet with low-intensity, long-duration rain events and rare snowfall. Summer is characterized by short-duration, high-intensity storm events and tropical depression storms are common. The seasonal runoff response to rain events is shown in Fig. 14.2. Approximately 22%, on average, of annual precipitation becomes runoff (Amatya et al., 2006), resulting in about 78%  evapotranspiration, assuming negligible seepage (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume). Approximately 60% of the runoff is contributed by shallow surface or runoff/rainwater, the rest by subsurface flow (Epps et al., 2013). Based on the FDC analysis this watershed produces flow only 56.3% of the time and hence has a zero value of Q90/Q50 (Plates 11 and 12, Table 14.2). The principal flow generation mechanism is driven by the shallow water table (Fig. 9.1, Chapter 9, this volume) (Harder et al., 2007; Epps et al., 2013), controlled primarily by rainfall and evapotranspiration, and minimally by deeper groundwater underlain by Santee Limestone approximately 20 m below the ground surface. The formation of an argillic horizon with poorly drained clayey subsoil provides a dynamic shallow groundwater table that has a complex non-linear relationship with streamflow (Harder et al., 2007). Saturation-excess surface and shallow subsurface runoff with rapid lateral transfers within the highly permeable upper soil layer may occur along reaches with flat topography. Surface depressional storage was shown to affect the surface runoff rate (Amoah et al., 2012). Runoff and peak flow at this watershed are dependent on both rainfall amount and intensity, as well as antecedent conditions reflected by initial water table positions (Epps et al., 2013). A key observation from WS80 is the reversal of the flow relationship between this and the treatment watershed, compared with the earlier calibration period, for a decade beginning three years after Hurricane Hugo severely damaged vegetation on both watersheds. As a result reduced evapotranspiration in selected hurricane-affected vegetation on the reference watershed enhanced its streamflow (Jayakaran et al., 2014).

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The general conceptual model of lateral preferential flow networks relies on the increase in soil wetness. As the soil wetness increases, there is an increase in the connections in the preferential flow network, causing faster subsurface velocities and increasing the area of hillslope contributing to runoff (Tsuboyama et al., 1994; Sidle et al., 2000; Uchida et al.,2005; Tromp-van Meerveld and McDonnell, 2006b). These excavations support this conceptual model. We observed that the preferential flow paths were connected by matrix flow through mineral and organic soils. In some areas, this saturated flow was perched above soil with low hydraulic conductivity and spread out horizontally in the overlying layers of more conductive soils. In other areas the flow had verti-\ncal components because the water was flowing downward to areas with higher conductivities. These observations showed that a connection may be established by increased soil wetness within a small localized area. The subsurface flow in this hillslope is highly dynamic and depends on the precipitation characteristics and antecedent condition. Trenched hillslopes from around the world have identified differences in subsurface flow characteristics based on the subsurface topography and the saturated zone connections of the hillslope and the trench (e.g. Tani, 1997; Hutchinson and Moore, 2000; Freer et al., 2002; Tromp van Meerveld and McDonnell, 2006a). The excavations presented here show that trenches with large contributing areas collect flow from preferential flow networks that are efficient at transferring water, due in part to a high degree of hydraulic connectivity. The soils in these areas could transport water one order of magnitude faster than other soils (Anderson et al., 2009). The dye staining also revealed that there is often little interaction between water in the preferential flow path and the surrounding soil matrix unless there was a constriction in the preferential flow network.', '4.2', '942', 'Conceptual models of runoff', 1, '1', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 144, 194, 144, 1, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'These tracer studies have demonstrated that in the CB1 catchment water moves through the vadose zone slowly at a rate predicted for steady state conditions by the rainfall rate and the volumetric water content of the soil. Under nonsteady wetting conditions, water is mobilized in the soil, but this water is dominantly old water. We did not see evidence for preferential flow of new water under either the steady low-intensity conditions of our sprinkling experiments or in two natural storms. Flow in the saturated zone at the base of the colluvium is rapid and, taking advantage of exfoliation fractures, crosses back and forth between rock and colluvium in the zone of convergent topography (of both the surface and the bedrock/ colluvium interface) down the axis of the catchment. The area of subsurface saturation in the colluvium near the channel head expands and contracts during storm events and, in so doing, exerts important control on the flow paths contributing runoff. Water percolating through the vadose zone in the colluvium mixes in this saturated area with water emerging from the bedrock. The bedrock flow path predominates under all flow conditions, but when the area of saturation near the weir grows both in areal extent and thickness during a  storm, an increasing proportion of runoff is derived from vertical percolation through colluvium above this area. As Hewlett and Hibbert [1967] predicted in their conceptual model, we see a greater contribution to storm runoff from the colluvium near the channel, while other parts of the slope contribute a higher proportion of base flow runoff. Moreover, the timing of generation of runoff does not appear to be tied to the rate at which water moves through the catchment. We believe that this type of subsurface variable source area is likely to be important in runoff generation and stream chemistry of other steep lands with shallow soils overlying fractured bedrock.', '6', '2650', 'Conclusions', 1, '1', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 145, 38, 145, 1, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The results presented here suggest that the relative activity of the groundwater in the fractured bedrock zone is indeed not inactive and plays just as important a role as that in the shallower soil and saprolite zones. Groundwater flow in the fractured bedrock zone is dynamic and may be an important flow pathway along the hillslope via a well-connected fracture network. The seasonal variation of the water levels in the nested piezometers and higher elevations during winter verify active groundwater recharge and discharge occurring along the hillslope and that groundwater movement is from the higher parts of the catchment to the valley bottom. Groundwater flow in the fractured bedrock aquifer appears to be significant. It is hypothesised that the hydraulic properties and high degree of connection between the soil, saprolite and fractured bedrock zones is a dominant control on the major contribution of groundwater to Scott Creek. The hydraulic and hydrochemical data suggest that the groundwater in the fractured bedrock zone is relatively well mixed and that there is some mixing of this water with the shallower groundwater in the soil and saprolite zones where the groundwater flow paths converge at the valley bottom prior to discharge to the creek. The data also shows that there is a hydraulic disconnection between the soil and saprolite zones with the deeper fractured bedrock in the upslope areas of the study site as a result of the increasing thickness of the soil and saprolite zones. Perched aquifers are established in the shallow soil zone and persist throughout the year. These shallow aquifer systems may play an important role in overland flow and throughflow to the creek as well as a ‘solute’ mixing zone of shallow and deep groundwater. Previous studies (Smettem et al. 1991; Leaney et al. 1993) at the Scott Creek field site have assumed that subsurface flow occurs in the shallow saprolite zone only. In striking contrast, the results of this study are important because they clearly show that groundwater flow in the deeper fractured bedrock zone is highly dynamic and an important groundwater flow pathway along the hillslope and readily exchanges with the creek. As a result, deep groundwater from the fractured bedrock aquifer is therefore expected to be a significant component in streamflow generation at Scott Creek.

Following clearing, the deep, permanent groundwater system beneath the Lemon catchment started to rise due to lower evapotranspiration. Groundwater level intersected the surface by 1987 and by 1996 achieved a new stability (Bari and Smettem, 2004). After heavy rainfall, a shallow intermittent groundwater system develops on caprock or clay, saturates part of the stream zone and generates streamflow by saturation excess overland flow and interflow processes. Immediately following clearing, the flow duration of Lemon catchment increased and started flowing about a month earlier than Ernies catchment (Fig. 3a). The groundwater induced stream zone saturated area increased from nil before clearing to 8% of the catchment area in 1990s. There was an approximately 1400 mm increase in unsaturated soilwater storage (Bari and Smettem, 2004). When the groundwater system reached the stream bed, streamflow increased further, became perennial and in the dry summer months was dominated by the baseflow (Fig. 3b).', '3', '324', 'Streamflow generation process', 1, '1', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 147, 123, 147, 1, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Features of the hydrology include the presence of a regional deep groundwater system, which accumulates at the bottom of a deeply weathered lateritic soil profile. Surface soils are typically highly permeable sands and gravels and permit infiltration of almost all throughfall. Consequently, forested catch- ments experience negligible surface runoff of the infiltration-excess (Hortonian) type. The clayey B horizon is less permeable and gives rise to substantial subsurface runoff at the interface between the A and B horizons and to the development of a seasonal perched water table in the valley bottoms This perched aquifer, in turn, provides a saturated source area where it intersects the surface and generates surface runoff by the saturation-excess (Dunne) mechanism. Williamson et al. [1987] estimated that surface runoff accounts for 4% of annual streamflow at Salmon, with subsurface through flow contributing about 90% and groundwater discharge about 6%. However, groundwater discharge is expected to be considerably less in lower rainfall regions. Groundwater recharge at Salmon has been estimated as 2.2% of annual rainfall [Johnston, 1983] and can take place either by matrix flow or through preferred pathways such as deep root channels.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', ' a perceptual model of runoff generation and lateral flows was developed: rain water infiltrates into the upper soil layer in most parts of the basin; it then quickly reaches the less permeable second soil layer and generates temporary saturation above it; this temporary saturation is perceived to have two effects:(a) It will generate quick lateral downslope flow through macropores in the upper soil layer (pipeflow), particularly in the steeper downslope sections of the valley. This lateral flow will represent a mixture of infiltrated event water and of pre-event water ''pressed out'' by the infiltrated event water, as described by McDonnell (1990). (b) It will cause percolation through the less permeable second soil layer at places where this layer is more permeable or penetrated (e.g. by roots etc.). The percolated water will then cause saturation on top of the bedrock with direct effects on basin discharge through pressure transfer to the valley floor and lower slopes. It will create immediate exfiltration of ''old'' pre-event water into the channel (piston flow), as described by Anderson et al. (1997) In both cases, delays in peak flow of about two days are assumed to be caused by the time required for the percolation of water to and through the second soil layer, which may be rather short, and for the formation of saturated zones in the subsurface. This understanding is in agreement with the observation of large amounts of pre-event water in flood streamflow in similar basins (Herrmann et al, 1986; Pearce et al., 1986; McDonnell, 1990; Uhlenbrook & Leibundgut, 1997). Finally the considerable differences in the observed direct runoff amounts (overland and interflow) deserve comment. In the Schàfertal, direct overland flow ranges from about 1 % of precipitation (runoff/precipitation) for the first event up to 7% or 5.5% for the second and third events respectively (see Fig. 1). It is understood that this flow is generated from the few roads and pathways in the Schàfertal and from some impervious and temporarily saturated areas. In the Waldbach this component is more stable (about 3%) due to the fact that dynamically varying saturated areas did not occur during the three events. More informative is the analysis of interflow runoff. During the first event interflow only occurred in the Waldbach with about 3% of precipitation. It increases here to nearly 50% of precipitation in the second and third events (see Fig. 1). In the Schàfertal basin an interflow component was observed only for the second event (about 1.6%), and up to about 20% for the third one. This difference is considered to be caused by the different land uses in the two basins; forest in the Waldbach and agriculture in the Schàfertal.', 'N/A', '200', 'SOIL STRUCTURE AND LAND COVER CONTROL OF RUNOFF GENERATION MECHANISMS AND LATERAL FLOWS', 1, '1', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 149, 207, 149, 1, 2, 2),

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Process studies have shown that such soils are saturated for much of the year and generate substantial amounts of saturation excess overland  flow and shallow lateral flow in organic surface horizons (Soulsby and Reynolds, 1993). Deeper peats (Histosols — HOST29) are also found fringing the stream channels and generate saturation excess overland flow during storm events (Tetzlaff et al., 2007a). The dominance of these hydrologically responsive soils gives the Girnock a flashy hydrological regime compared to catchments in Scotland with more freely draining soils. The second most common soil units (covering 24% of the catchment, HOST 17) comprise freely draining brown soils (Cambisols), humus  iron podzols (Haplic Podzol) and deeper subalpine podzols (Fragic Podzols). Vertical water movement mainly facilitates groundwater recharge in such soils (Soulsby et al., 1998). Alpine soils (Regosols) and rankers (HOST 22, 27) are found on the higher altitude slopes in the upper catchment, and fractured bedrock outcrops suggest that these may also be important recharge zones (Tetzlaff et al., 2007a). Chemically based  hydrograph separations indicate that 25 – 35% of annual runoff from the catchment is derived from higher alkalinity groundwater (Soulsby et al., 2007). Soulsby et al. (2005) have indicated that a portion of groundwater recharge probably moves quickly through shallow fracture systems or freely draining drift deposits to discharge in valley bottom areas.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'From discharge data it is concluded that in this catchment two main factors are dominant. First, a fast response to rainfall (short response times and quick recessions), which means fast runoff processes (e.g. movement in the unsaturated zone, preferential flow, pressure wave/piston flow, kinematic wave). Several factors suggest vertical preferential flow, e.g. the high variability of throughfall and thus also soil moisture, the soil moisture dynamics and the temporally persistent smallscale soil moisture patterns (Blume et al., 2007a), plus the fact that the catchment is dominated by forests, where preferential flow patterns were observed in all dye tracer experiments (Blume et al, this issue). Vertical preferential flow (flow along roots or fingering) is therefore likely the rule and not the exception in this catchment. On the other hand, the fast response of streamflow while groundwater response lags behind suggests rapid lateral flow. This is further supported by the fact that during rainfall events an increase in soil moisture was observed in deeper layers while the horizons above showed no response. Wetting of this deeper layer thus did not result from vertical percolation (Blume et al., 2007a). The layer interfaces resulting from the textural differences between different layers of volcanic ash (from gravel fraction to silty sand) can serve as flow paths and are likely to enhance fast lateral flow processes. However, connectivity of these gravel layers along the hillslopes is necessary to make them hydrologically relevant on hillslope or catchment scale. Furthermore, a large soil water/groundwater storage seems to exist, generating flow even after several weeks of drought. This perception is further supported by the fact that event runoff coefficients are low and yearly runoff coefficients are high, and by soil characteristics, such as high porosities (determined in the laboratory) and the large unsaturated zone, as confirmed by augering and geo-electrical sounding (Figure 5). The results of the tracer study presented in Blume et al. (this issue) show that a shift in processes occurs from winter to summer: changes were observed in flow patterns, groundwater–surface water interactions and in the response of stream chemistry to rainfall events. Hydrophobicity is likely to have an effect after extended dry periods, causing persistent small-scale soil moisture patterns and fingering (Blume et al., 2007a). In addition, response times of streamflow, soil moisture and groundwater were shorter for summer events (Blume et al., 2007a).', 'N/A', '3671', 'Runoff generation processes —conclusions and open questions', 1, '4', 'Forest described', 'Soil texture described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'Multiple interpretations demonstrated', 'N', 154, 139, 154, 1, 10, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'A principal finding was that during the wet season, saturation overland flow (as well as subsurface stormflow principally in the top 0.2 m depth) occurred spatially much more extensively during large monsoon events (Bonell et al., 1981) than had previously been supported in the literature from humid temperate latitudes (see reviews of Dunne (1983) and Buttle (1994)). The complementary environmental tracer work (which used both deuterium and non-isotopes) confirmed one of the hypothesis (originating from the hydrometric campaign) that the storm hydrograph consists of a much larger proportion of ''new'' water (60-70% for South Creek undisturbed and 70-80% for North Creek - disturbed, Bonell et al, 1997; 50-70% South Creek, Elsenbeer et al, 1995b) than established in most humid temperate studies. In fact, around the hydrograph peak, event water proportions can exceed 90% especially from the topographically steeper, South Creek (Bonell et al, 1997). In a separate study using EMMA, Elsenbeer et al (1995a, p. 2273) remarked for one event that ''...the contribution of saturation overland flow reaches almost 80%o near peak flow at which time the groundwater contribution nearly vanishes.'' Nonetheless, up to five contributing ''reservoirs'' to the storm hydrograph, were identified which could only be established by access to a more sophisticated hydrometric data base to complement the intermittent water sampling on the hillslopes (for previously stated technical reasons) (Bonell & Barnes, 1997). The upper two stores as expected, were saturation overland flow and shallow subsurface stormflow. The continuous records from piezometers and soil-water pressure transducers however, indicated exfiltration (return flow, Chorley, 1978, p. 371) occurrence at selected points so that this flow vector would modify the more-biased event signature of saturation overland flow, and thus complicate attempts at chemical storm hydrograph separation. (Bonell et al., 1997). Such modification of the surface flow vector was inferred from chemical analysis of water samples taken from shallow rills during storms and using EMMA (Elsenbeer et al, 1994, 1995a). The third possible reservoir was the detected convergence of upward/downward fluxes of soil water during transient, saturation at more substantial depths in the deep vadose zone. Even more surprising was the detection of macropore flow penetration to up to 7 m depth during large storms whose isotopic signature was not completely mixed with the surrounding matrix water (based on sampling pipeflow (Elsenbeer & Bonell, unpublished data)). Consequently the upper layer of the deep permanent groundwater is the recipient of this macropore flow, and acts as a mixing zone, thus giving a fourth reservoir on the lines described by Andersen & Burt (1982). Finally beneath is the fifth reservoir, which is a large, deep body of well-mixed groundwater whose capacity from modelling (Barnes & Bonell, 1996) was estimated to be in the order of 3000 mm. When concerning modelling despite this complexity (in terms of spatial and temporal contributions from up to four subsurface reservoirs) such diverse origins would seem in the first instance to be minimized by ''collapsing'' all these sources into one ''subsurface'' compartment. The return flow component formed part of the surface compartment, along with saturation overland flow (Barnes & Bonell, 1996). Despite the long previous hydrometric campaign, several new features were detected which led to a better understanding of storm runoff generation. By following a dual hydrometric-hydrochemistry approach, there was recognition of the greater importance of the deep, permanent groundwater table in terms of its contributions of ''old'' water to the storm hydrograph soon after peak discharge occurred. Thus this feature was much more connected to the surface hydrology than it was previously thought (Bonell et a/., 1981). In addition, the detection of deep, vertical macropore flow, whose characteristics more favored the description of Mosley (1979, 1982), cf. Pearce et al. (1986), could be attributed to the prevailing high rain intensities (Bonell et al., 1997). Moreover, there was no evidence for the existence of groundwater ridging. A sampled water table profile adjacent to organized drainage showed the characteristics of a more traditional, free water surface profile. During the course of storms, the gradient steepened in response to macropore flow and subsequently relaxed towards, or at the termination of an event, which thus provided the capability of contributing significant groundwater contributions to organized surface drainage (especially from the upper, fourth reservoir). As, previously indicated, the work also supported the notion of a very high, effective hydraulic conductivity (Bazemore et al, 1994; Bonell & Barnes, 1997) for the catchment, which also utilized an input, from the Barnes & Bonell (1996) model, to calculate the peak from the ''slow'' flow hydrograph. The fact that the effective hydraulic conductivity is in the same order of magnitude as separate measurements of field saturated hydraulic conductivity for the top 0.1 m of soil suggests that the transmissivity feedback concept of Bishop (1991), through subsurface stormflow and return flow, could be the primary explanation supplemented by described macropore flow in the deeper subsoil, including from pipes (Bonell & Barnes, 1997). There was no need to search for a particular type of groundwater mechanism, i.e., ridging (Bonell & Barnes, 1997). In addition, the hydrometric hydrochemistry approach supported the Bonell-Cassells mechanism (Cassells et al, 1985; named and reviewed in Crapper & Barnes, 1993), whereby the intense tropical rainfall rapidly exceeds the superficial unsaturated zone storage capacity of the soil profile, and is independent of any downslope subsurface stormflow. This mechanism is capable of inducing near-instantaneous areas of saturation over a large area of the catchment. Nevertheless the recognition of more significant vertical, preferential flow via macropores has caused a modification of the conceptual model previously put forward in Bonell (1993, fig. 1). The shallow ''impeding'' layer (>0,2m depth) is penetrated by spatially-variable, preferential flow.', 'N/A', '173', 'The Babinda catchments, north-east Queensland', 1, '3', 'N', 'Soil hydraulic properties described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 155, 219, 155, 1, 6, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'This work has indicated that in this particular tropical rainforest environment the variable source area concept, associated with humid temperate areas, is not applicable due to the characteristics of rainfall intensity. Spearman''s rank correlation analysis indicated that this applied to both seasons, despite some detailed differences, providing the assumption of a linear relation is correct. Thus the rainfall intensity is sufficient to exceed the average ks for depths below 20 cm and therefore create a widespread perched water table, and corresponding subsurface flow, within the top 20 cm. Once this upper store has been filled, its emergence at the surface develops an ''impermeable'' surface and therefore leads to widespread saturation overland flow which can be tapped by a temporary dense drainage network. This phenomenon is thought to continue for the remainder of the storm. The only doubt raised by Spearman''s correlation analysis was during the summer period when storms in 1976 were generally of shorter duration than normal and where a slope is underlain by residual rocks in the deeply weathered clays, e.g. site la. It is hoped to examine this problem further with more sophisticated statistical analysis once continuous records become available. The significance of subsurface flow contribution to the storm hydrograph, originating from the perched water table, becomes greater in the presence of residual rock. However, this does not preclude large volumes of overland flow occurring even on the steeper, well drained slopes in contrast with the situation in humid temperate areas.', 'N/A', '381', 'Conclusion', 1, '2', 'Forest described', 'Soil hydraulic properties described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'Limitations discussed', 'N', 156, 219, 156, 1, 1, 2),

However ks decreases sharply with depth so that the 10--20 cm zone has values of only 1.5 m/day and this decreases to 0.3 m/day for the 20--100 cm zone. This means that moderate rainfall intensities will not infiltrate readily below 20 cm and high rainfall intensities will n o t infiltrate below 10 cm. Consequently saturation will occur above these layers and continued rainfall results in the development of a temporary saturated zone which rises to the soil surface producing saturation overland flow over the soil surface and lateral subsurface flow through the permeable zone above 20 cm.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Despite the high surface ks values of the forest soil, large volumes of runoff were recorded from the surface troughs at all three sites during summer monsoon and post-monsoon ''transitional'' season storms. The high rainfall intensities rapidly exceed the ks of the impeding layer below 20 cm. The end result is the development of a perched water table in the upper horizon which quickly leads to ''saturation overland flow'' (Kirkby & Chorley, 1967; Kirkby, 1978). The runoff collected in the surface trough in considered to be a mixture of ''surface storm flow'' and ''subsurface storm flow'' of Hewlett (1974). This particularly applies during the intensity peaks when throughfall fails to enter the soil mineral surface and combines with exfiltrated water (Hewlett & Troendle, 1975). The South Creek discharge hydrograph similarly shows a sharp response with frequently more than 45% of the total storm rainfall appearing as quickflow. This sharp response can also be attributed to the steep catchment slopes and the activation of numerous ephemeral creeks which result in a rapid increase in drainage density. Therefore only a short transit downslope of saturation overland flow is possible before it is tapped by organized drainage lines.

The fractured basement aquifer is characterised by a transition towards a quasi-porous aquifer in its overlaying weathering zone. This vadose zone is structured and consists of a saprolithic weathering zone above the migmatitic basement followed by a lateritic strengthened horizon which is overlaid by mostly highly permeable sandy topsoil. The saprolithic weathering zone has a mean thickness of about 12 m and is only partly saturated due to the high variability of the water table between dry and wet season. Pumping tests proved the reaction of the vadose zone as a leaky (semi-confined) quasi-porous aquifer with the lateritic strengthened zone as a low permeable upper boundary. The development of the soil water content in the vadose zone can clearly be explained with respect to geology and lithology. Both a clear dependence of the soil moisture content on the substrate as well as a strong influence of low permeable horizons on the percolating water is evident. The lateritic strengthened horizons act as aquitards, where percolation of the infiltrating precipitation water is redirected. While this part of the percolate contributes to the surface water (interflow), another part is able to pass the nearly impermeable lateritic horizons through preferential flow paths (thick arrow in the centre of Fig. 6) and thus contributes to the groundwater recharge. This local groundwater recharge only can take place in periods with high soil water content (about mid-August to mid-October in central Benin). Significant differences between groundwater and soil water chemistry engage that the deeper aquifer is replenished mainly by lateral inflow from outside and that the upper aquifer and the lower aquifer are disconnected to a large extent. From the hydrogeological analysis it can be concluded that on the local scale fast surface and subsurface processes are dominant, local scale groundwater recharge occurs by preferential flow, but is quantitatively of minor importance. Analyses on environmental tracers indicate that groundwater does not directly take part in the local scale water cycle, but is much more importance on the regional scale. Therefore hydrological models on different scales have to consider groundwater processes in different ways.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The steep rising and recession limbs of the stormflow hydrographs indicated a rapid flowpath to the stream channel. Because overland flow was minimal, rapid flow through a macroporous medium was inferred, that may include macropores (Beven and Germann, 1982), cracks in the soil (McDonnell, 1990), or soil layers of differing hydraulic conductivity (Chappell et al., 1990; McDonnell et al., 1991). This inference is supported by the sound of water flowing during precipitation events immediately under the organic-covered rocky overburden common throughout the Catskills (P. Murdoch, personal communication). The inability of throughfall on the saturated channel area to fully account for the event-water contributions estimated from the two-component isotopic separation suggests a contribution from a source other than throughfall, but with an isotopic signature similar to throughfall. Only the water collected from the O-horizon had a δ18O composition heavy enough to explain the isotopic response in stormflow. [...] The O-horizon component is postulated to occur as lateral flow above the mineral soil surface as described by McDonnell et al. (1991). The high contrast in hydraulic conductivity between the porous organic material and the mineral horizon promotes lateral flow during precipitation events (Chappell et al., 1990). Water content in the upper soil profile increased and decreased more rapidly and to a greater extent than the water content in the deeper soil in response to rain events, supporting the shallow lateral-flow hypothesis. The shallow soil water, however, may have drained either in a lateral direction toward the stream channel or in a vertical direction deeper in the soil. But water from the upper soil layer that was distinct from deeper soil water accounted for the response of DOC concentrations and δ18O in stormflow, suggesting the importance of lateral flow to the stream from the upper soil layer. Bypass flow to bedrock is inferred from the rapid response of the water table on the hillslope relative to the delayed response of water content in the mineral soil immediately above the water table. Groundwater levels, however, did not increase sufficiently to reach the organic horizon (increasing only 0.05–0.3 m in the 1–1.5 m soil) as might be expected in a transmissivity feedback process (Bishop et al., 1990).

Intermittent springs are formed by (a convergence of) faults and preferential flow of groundwater through perpendicular joints and fissures. Forest is the dominant land use. The dominant runoff component was subsurface stormflow, followed by groundwater and surface runoff. Macropores (fissures, root channels etc.) in clay-shale/limestone slopes may produce rapid water percolation and subsoil drainage (Bogaard et al. 2012). Small runoff coefficients (2.8% and 12.98%) also indicate little generation of surface runoff. Separation between event and pre-event water was not conclusive. At the catchment scale (Fig. 8(b)), we find an approximately 1 km wide alluvial valley with an estimated thickness of 15 m (Calderon et al. (2014). Land use is more diverse, including pasture and agriculture as opposed to the forested sub-catchments. At this scale, the composition of total runoff is influenced by antecedent rainfall events. Groundwater dominates in dry soil conditions and surface runoff is the dominant component when soils are (nearly) saturated. This agrees with the dominant pre-event water during drier conditions and event water during wetter conditions.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'In the upstream area, granite is the dominant formation explaining the lower ionic content in groundwater, in contrast to the downstream areas, where geologically diverse formations and land use increase the ionic content of groundwater. The weathered granite layer allows rain to infiltrate to the deeper groundwater reservoir through preferential flowpaths with less contact time for weathering processes to occur. This explains the hydrochemical signature of the deep groundwater component, which is characterized by its moderate electrical conductivities, moderate to high dissolved silica, lower ionic content, and low potassium concentrations. The chemical signature of the shallow groundwater component is characterized by the high electrical conductivities, alkalinity, sulfates, potassium, and nitrates that are washed from top geological layers with large ionic content and land uses such as agriculture and mining that are more predominant in the downstream region of the catchment. The three-component hydrograph separations suggest that the shallow groundwater component (potentially including surface runoff) is quickly activated during rainfall events, and its contribution increases as the antecedent precipitation increases as observed during Events 1 and 4, where the shallow groundwater contributions were 45 and 20–21 %, respectively. Moreover, a connection between surface and groundwater is evident from the groundwater contour map (Fig. 2d), which shows a gaining river system, and from the flow duration curves, which indicate exfiltrating groundwater storages to the streams. Further literature (Hughes, 2010) suggests that most of South Africa’s groundwater is stored in secondary aquifers and that surface flow may be nourished by lateral flow from semi-saturated fracture systems after storm events. Other studies (Petersen, 2012) in the nearby Kruger National Park (KNP) have shown that groundwater recharge occurs mostly during the wet season and groundwater flow travels in accordance with the topographical relief. Petersen (2012) studied a granite-dominated area and a basaltic-rock-dominated area, approximately 30 km east of the Kaap outlet. The study found that the granite region was mainly characterized by the steep topography, which favors overland flow that infiltrates through depressions, cracks and fractures by preferential pathways, while the southern basaltic section with a flatter topography showed piston flow processes to be more predominant. The Petersen (2012) findings, covering studies of approximately 1011 boreholes in the KNP, support the findings in the Kaap catchment where high fracturing in the granite section allows recharge of deeper groundwater reservoirs through preferential flowpaths.', '5.1', '4194', 'Runoff processes in the Kaap catchment', 1, '4', 'N', 'Soil types described', 'Geological types described', 'Slopes described', 'N', 'Uncertainty described', 'N', 163, 110, 163, 1, 5, 2),

The small surface-saturated area of the catchment cannot explain event water contributions of ca 8% indicated by hydrograph separations. Well data show that the water tables reside in near-surface organic layers, especially at lower slope locations, indicating that rapid flow within the organic layer provides water for streamflow by nature of its higher hydraulic conductivity (Figure 2), allowing some event water (possibly through preferential or bypass flow) to reach the stream with little mixing. Both two- and tree-component separations indicate an overwhelming portion of stormflow water exists within the catchment prior to the event. Three-component hydrograph separations show that flow through the mineral substrate, not the organic layer, dominates stormflow response. Whether significant mixing between mineral- and organic-layer water occurs during storms, thus reducing the apparent organic flow contributions, is unclear. The hydrological and hydrochemical interaction between the riparian zone and the hillslope is an area of considerable uncertainty, and the extent to which the riparian zone modifies hillslope DOC and water chemistry is potentially large. McGlynn and McDonnell (2003) found no evidence that riparian zones exhibit DOC flushing in a temperate catchment, and that the temporally dynamic mixing of spatial sources of runoff controlled the observed patterns of runoff at both the slope and small catchment scale. The near-surface position of the phreatic surface controls the larger volumes of runoff observed in Storm 1, as the concept of transmissivity feedback (Bishop, 1991) applies to organic-covered permafrost slopes (Quinton et al., 2000). As summer progresses and water tables fall deeper within the porous organic soil, more precipitation must be applied to raise water tables and increase runoff rates and ratios. The descent of the frost table on permafrost-underlain slopes moderates water table positions, encouraging enhanced drainage compared with permafrost-free slopes (Carey and Woo, 2001a). On the permafrost-free Sf-slope, the water table was significantly lower at upslope locations, indicating reduced runoff, yet remained near the surface in riparian zones. Using hydrochemical and isotopic methods, it was not possible to distinguish between slopes with seasonal frost and permafrost.', 'N/A', '111', 'Summer runoff mechanisms', 4, '2', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'Uncertainty described', 'N', 164, 82, 164, 7, 1, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Although no preferential flow was observed, results from this study using stable isotope and simple hydrochemical indicators support these observations and highlight the increased importance of temporary storage at the onset of melt. At the beginning of the melt period, meltwater percolating from the snowpack infiltrates the frozen ground, which is typically unsaturated. On slopes with permafrost soils and an organic cover, infiltration is restricted to the porous organic soils whereas, on slopes with seasonal frost, percolation is uninhibited unless there are ice-rich layers at depth (Kane and Stein 1983). The isotopic signature of liquid soil water at this time becomes strongly depleted with respect to d18O suggesting large meltwater recharge (Figure 4). Additionally, soil temperatures are ca. 08C, as meltwater infiltrating the soil provides little sensible heat to melt pore water, thus reducing the mixing of melt and pre-melt pore water until soil thaw begins. During these early melt stages, there is little lateral transfer of water to the stream until the unsaturated storage capacity of the soils declines and soil thaw allows runoff pathways to become exposed. Once snow-free areas increase and a perched water table is formed, runoff is rapidly conveyed to the stream from permafrost-underlain slopes with a strong meltwater isotope signature (Figure 4). Hydrochemically, DOC that is removed from organic soils in the meltwater solution is flushed during this initial runoff pulse (Carey 2003). The decline in streamflow SpC occurs following the initial DOC and d18 O depletion signal from the initial storage release, as meltwater is then allowed to pass rapidly from the melting snowpack to the stream via the organic layer, bypassing the significant interaction with underlying mineral soils. The fraction of meltwater contributing to streamflow declines, however, as pore water within the organic layer melts, mixing with and being displaced by meltwater. During peak freshet, the continued dominance of flow through the organic layer is supported by the decline in stream Spc and pH, the latter occuring due to acidification from organic-layer water. Near the end of the freshet period, meltwater infiltration continues, yet mixing with subsurface soils, including those from the mineral layer, dilutes the melt d18O signature and displaces pre-melt stored water. As the freshet period ends, thaw allows interaction with the mineral soils as evidenced by the increase in stream SpC and pH whereas DOC has declined to near pre-freshet levels.', 'N/A', '321', 'Snowmelt runoff mechanism', 1, '5', 'N', 'Soil types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 165, 82, 165, 1, 4, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Hydrometric, DOC and δ18O data showed that soils with stagnic and peaty properties controlled the runoff process. During a rainfall event these soils showed saturation caused by low hydraulic conductivity in deeper soil layers. The dominating runoff generation process is saturation excess flow (surface and shallow subsurface runoff) with a high degree of soil water exchange during events, indicated by the high DOC load and a low pH. The fast response of the headwater was a result of the dense artificial drainage system. It enhanced the runoff reaction by a better connectivity to the main stream. Although the mixing process and mixing locations of event water and soil water remain unclear, a mixing at the surface-soil-interface is suggested (e.g. due to return flow), and a mixing in the stream, where surface runoff and lateral subsoil inputs meet. Using event C from Fig. 3, a conceptual model for the runoff generation in the headwaters was developed (Fig. 6). At the beginning of runoff the DOC concentration was low. Runoff consisted mostly of surface runoff on forest tracks (Fig. 6 (ix)), channel precipitation, drainage of deeper horizons and a few small saturated areas near the stream (vi, vii). The second rainfall peak caused complete saturation of the soil. A maximum concentration of DOC in the stream was reached because lateral runoff components through the organic layer (v) became dominant, discharging old soil water and slowly replacing it. Further infiltration was inhibited by water saturation, causing surface runoff in the form of saturation excess flow (iii), which diluted the DOC-rich soil water with precipitation water. A new maximum of the DOC concentration was reached when surface runoff ceased. Decreasing levels of saturation due to lateral drainage (v, vi, vii) and groundwater recharge (viii) lowered the level of saturation and caused a decrease of DOC concentrations because of an increasing dominance of deeper runoff components.

The occurrence of a strong reduction of hydraulic conductivity at the plinthite layer at that site contributed to maintaining the soil close to saturation during most of the rainy season and led to some saturation overland flow under forest but much more frequent saturation overland flow in pasture (Moraes et al., 2006).

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'In the glacierized, discontinuous permafrost Tarfala catchment post-snowmelt, summer streamflow is largely derived from water that existed in the catchment prior to storm events (e.g. glacier melt, groundwater and soil water). However, the season average event water fractions estimated in this study (11% in 2004, 22% in 2011) are in the low range of results reported for non-glacierized permafrost catchments and show substantial variability between both years (Obradovic and Sklash, 1986; McNamara et al., 1997; Carey and Quinton, 2005; Carey et al., 2009; Boucher and Carey, 2010). The results of this study suggest that inter-annual and intra-annual differences in the event water contributions may be explained by differences in the water balance, particularly the timing and magnitude of rainfall events, and the interplay between catchment and seasonal glacier storage. This is particularly indicated by the spatiotemporal differences in event water contributions observed in 2011. In glacierized catchments, much of the catchment storage in non-glacier covered areas is, similar to permafrost catchments, defined by the active layer depth in permafrost–underlain areas (McNamara et al., 1997). The assumption for permafrost settings is that low storage capacity due to frozen soils could result in event water (i.e. precipitation) dominating the hydrograph (Obradovic and Sklash, 1986; McNamara et al., 1997; Boucher and Carey, 2010). However, studies in permafrost catchments, which are typically characterized by lower annual or summer precipitation amounts, show that similar to non-arctic regions, summer storms occurring in the post-snowmelt period are dominated by pre-event or old water (e.g. Obradovic and Sklash, 1986; Gibson et al., 1993; McNamara et al., 1997; Carey and Quinton, 2005). During the post-snowmelt season when active layer depth is greatest, the pathways that runoff takes in non-glacier covered areas are strongly controlled by soil moisture conditions (McNamara et al., 1997). Rainfall events occurring when catchment soils are near saturation at the surface such that overland flow pathways convey water rapidly to the stream in a positive feedback manner will result in faster runoff rates and more runoff from precipitation events (Boucher and Carey, 2010). In this study, existence of these feedback mechanisms is supported by the increasing event water fractions observed during the 2011 summer season and the occurrence of rainfall-induced floods after periods with high-antecedent rainfall (e.g. September 2011) (Figures 3 and 4). As indicated by the 4–10 September 2011 rainfall period, which included the largest daily precipitation amount observed in 2011, an average event water fraction of 34% was contributed to the Tarfala stream. This is suggesting that the effect of catchment soil storage on rainfall–runoff translation in glacierized catchments seems to be coupled to the timing and magnitude of rainfall events. Results from this study suggest that occurrence of high magnitude rainfall events at the end of the summer season in conjunction with large antecedent precipitation causes catchment soils to saturate and water to precipitate onto the catchment to be transferred directly to the stream. This clearly resulted in greater event water contributions than that observed in the first half of the summer season (Figures 3 and 4). These rainfall–runoff dynamics suggest that the role of catchment storage might become almost negligible in glacierized catchments receiving large precipitation amounts than assumed for typical permafrost-dominated catchments. This is corroborated by the decreasing trend in event water contributions observed over the summer 2004 season, which coincided with a decrease in summer rainfall magnitudes over the same period.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The soil hydraulic properties and rainfall intensity regime had implications for runoff flow paths in these catchments. Although rainfall intensities (Figure 5) rarely, if ever, exceeded the estimated infiltration capacities in the forest, around 75% of storm-averaged rainfall intensities exceeded the pasture Ksat near the surface (Figure 6) and infiltration capacities of 18–20 mm h 1 that we have measured in Rondˆonia pastures, pointing to frequent occurrence of Horton overland flow (HOF). The strong anisotropy of Ksat in both soils allowed the development of a perched water table, shallow SSF, and SOF in all surveyed cover types. The particularly low values of Ksat at the plinthite level reduce vertical recharge, favouring the surface and near-surface flowpaths. [...] In the forest, no 15-min rainfall intensity exceeded even the lowest of the measured Ksat values near the surface, suggesting that HOF was not generated. The high values of infiltration capacity under the FC, and the frequent high moisture content throughout the wet season (Figure 7), indicated that the runoff generating mechanism is SOF. The saturation may have been limited to the upper layers of soil because the average Ksat value declined from 230 mm h 1 at 0Ð10 m depth to about 17 mm h 1 at 0Ð25 m depth (Figure 6(a)). The small quantities of SSF reflected the low Ksat values of this soil, even above the plinthite. For example, if the forest soil was fully saturated above the plinthite when SSF outflow rates from a 10-m long hillslope on a gradient of 0Ð30 were 1 mm d 1 (Figure 8(a)), the depth-averaged Ksat would be 0Ð037 m and the transmissivity 0Ð033 m2 d 1 . If the average measured Ksat from Figure 6(a) is regressed against depth [Ksat D 4Ð6 exp  7Ð06 d  where d D depth (m); n D 4; r2 D 0Ð89], and integrated from 0Ð9 m depth to the soil surface, the result is a transmissivity value of about 0Ð7 m2 d 1 , but only a portion of this value would be utilized if the water table drained out of the uppermost soil layer soon after the end of rainfall (Figure 8). [...] In most of the events, more SSF was measured in the pasture trough than under the forest trough, although occasionally the reverse was true. Given the generally higher moisture contents and water table elevations at the pasture sites, a larger fraction of the surviving macropores were probably utilized in most storms, but when the forest soils were fully wetted, a larger set of macropores, reflected by the outliers (not shown in Figure 6) would be available', 'N/A', '2518', 'Results and Discussion: Runoff Processes', 2, '2', 'Multiple land-covers described', 'Soil types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 172, 69, 172, 8, 1, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Fig. 4 demonstrates the importance of overland flow as a hydrological flowpath in this primary rainforest environment. Overland flow may occur anywhere in the portion of the catchment covered by the 72 detectors, but more frequently in certain restricted places which we termed concentrated-flow lines where no incision was obvious. In some cases, such flow lines could be traced to the outlets of soil pipes (see Fig. 4 for examples). Apart from return flow from soil pipes, the rough microtopography also favours overland flow in concentrated-flow lines. These two factors override any topographic influence one might take for granted. For example, the ridge that separates the twoprominent gullies is an area of divergence, and yet we registered overland flow quite frequently in this landscape position. In contrast, downslope positions do not seem to be favoured over other slope positions. This apparent inconsistency has been resolved by investigating the factors that control the generation of overland flow (Elsenbeer and Cassel, 1991). Briefly, this investigation provided a rationale for saturation overland flow, Horton overland flow, and the already-mentioned return flow; the two latter forms of overland flow are, of course, independent of topography. Fig. 4 may be summarized by stating that one out of three precipitation events produced overland flow at 50% or more of the sites.\nFig. 5 shows hydrometric details for the events of 22 January and 1 September 1988. The rainy season event triggered overland flow at all three sites. The antecedent moisture conditions (see Table 1) suggest that OF at S2 was generated by saturation excess. The volumetric contribution of this site was small compared with S3 where return flow from pipe 6 contributes substantially to overland flow. The absence of a double peak in the hydrograph of S3 indicates a large contributing volume that dampens the effect of variations in rainfall intensity, in contrast to S1 and S2. The dry season event, too, generated OF at all sites. S2 is not included in Fig. 5 because of its small volume (Table 1). S2 is in a landscape position where Horton overland flow may occur (Elsenbeer and Cassel, 1991, p. 217). Notwithstanding the small volume produced, the very dry antecedent moisture conditions combined with a high rainfall intensity implicate infiltration excess as the OF-generating mechanism at this site for this event. Despite the dry conditions, return flow at S1 and S3 via pipes 3 and 6, respectively (see Fig. 4) was triggered with a very short response time. The fast flowpath ''overland flow'' is being activated regardless of antecedent moisture conditions; the latter merely control its volumetric contribution to streamflow.', '4.1', '242', 'Hydrometric observations', 2, '2', 'Forest described', 'N', 'N', 'Topography described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 173, 119, 173, 7, 1, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The soil anisotropy discussed above, and expressed in the change of Ksat with depth, is very pronounced at La Cuenca (Figure 4). The uppermost 0.1 m of soil is permeable enough to rule out Hortonian overland flow in most places, although the position of the two rainfall intensity reference lines (see also Table II) suggests the existence of ‘partial contributing areas’. Lateral subsurface flow, however, is to be expected owing to the marked decrease of Ksat over the next depth increments in relation to the prevailing rainfall intensities. A hydrological discontinuity at a depth of about 0.1-0.2 m is the salient feature controlling the runoff generation in this environment, given the prevailing rainfall characteristics. This vertical hydrological discontinuity is, however, discontinuous spatially, as indicated by the numerous outlying data points in Figure 4. This suggests a connection of near-surface flowpaths and deep soil or groundwater. The existence of a perched water table at the hydrological discontinuity also may be inferred from a time-series of matric potential values at a depth of 0.3 m (Figure 5). Positive pressure heads persist for considerable periods of time, and departures from near-saturation occur only during the dry season and short dry spells at other times. Therefore, the combination of rainfall characteristics (Table III) and soil anisotropy in this environment is conducive to lateral near-surface flow. This contrasts with the region around Manaus in central Amazonia that has been the focus of hydrological studies at the hillslope and catchment scale (Franken, 1979; Nortcliff et al., 1979; Lesack, 1993 inter alia). The salient soilscape features of the study sites Reserva Ducke, Bacia Modelo and Lago Calado are Oxisols (Soil Survey Staff, 1975), with only weakly pronounced changes of hydraulic properties with depth, and extensive riparian zones. This soil type covers large, but far from all, areas of the Amazon basin (Sombroek, 1984; Tanaka et al., 1986, 1989). There is no clear relationship between soil type and hydraulic-properties-depth relationships at this taxonomic level. The range of soil types, however, within the orders Oxisols and Ultisols, which are the dominant ones in the Amazon basin, implies a range of patterns in hydraulic-properties-depth relationships. Together with a considerable landscape diversity (Klammer, 1984), this assumption supports the basic tenet that a wide, still undefined, spectrum of flowpaths can be expected to operate in Amazonian rainforests. The following paragraphs deal with the nature of these flowpaths and their link with storm flow.\nThe occurrence of overland flow. Plate 1 depicts the frequency of overland flow occurrence with respect to the compound topographic index ln (a/tan b), where a is the upslope contributing area per unit contour length and b is the local slope. This index was calculated with TOPOG’s digital elevation and surface discretization model (Vertessy et al., 1990), which yields an element network in the form of flow strips. Under the assumption of saturation-excess as the prevailing mechanism for the generation of overland flow, a higher frequency is expected for areas with high index values. This is not the case. Rather, point sources, in the form of pipe outlets, are responsible for the observed high frequency of overland flow in at least several places (Plate 1). Consequently, overland flow, and subsurface storm flow generated at the hydrological discontinuity discussed above, are closely linked in many places. This discontinuity, then, gives rise to overland flow generated by return flow and by surface saturation. In the case of the monitoring sites, return flow from pipes 3 and 6 contributed substantially to the runoff monitored at sites S1 and S3, respectively (see Figure 3 for locations). With no discernible out flow from pipes or macropores upslope from S3, we assume that overland flow recorded at this site is predominantly generated by saturation excess. Figure 6 shows the frequency of overland flow and volumes produced in 1987 at monitoring sites S1 and S2. The frequency of overland flow is higher at the downslope site S2, whereas larger volumes are associated with out flow from pipe 3 at the upslope site S1. Site S3 has a frequency in between S1 and S2, and larger volumes than S1; its recording limit of 500 l was exceeded frequently.', 'N/A', '2373', 'Results and Discussion', 2, '1', 'N', 'Soil hydraulic properties described', 'N', 'Topography described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 174, 119, 174, 2, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The chemical characterization of hydrologicpathways at La Cuenca demonstrates that knowledge of fast pathways is mandatory for a complete description of watershed chemistry. By implication, it is also mandatory for hydrochemical modeling based on mixing of end-members or components. The chemical signature of fast flowpaths is distinct from that of slow flow paths in the soil and weathering zone, and an attempt to explain stream water chemistry as a mixture of groundwater and soil water would ignore a dominant hydrologic process in this environment. Indeed, soil water itself does not appear to affect streamflow chemistry: During base flow conditions the groundwater chemical signal is overwhelming, and during storm flow conditions, fast flow paths leave their imprint. Given that overlandflow is in many places generated by pipe flow, the chemical distinction between the two becomes questionable: Whatever runoff reaches the stream channel via the soil surfaceis likely to be a mixture of pipe flow, and overland flow actually generated at the soil surface, unless there is evidence that a substantial amount of water reaches the stream directly via pipes or as overland flow not generated as return flow. From a catchment perspective the distinction between pipe flow and overland flow is meaningless: There is one fast flow path, exemplifiedby OF2, which is neither entirely at the soil surface nor entirely below it. The hydrochemical fingerprint of this fast flow path differs significantly from the respective soil water and groundwater signals. As was shown, a detailed investigation of individual flow paths is required to separate pipe flow and ''true'' overland flow contributions. To avoid the exclusive subsurface connotation of pipe flow (often classified as subsurface stormflow) and the exclusive surface connotation of overland flow, the term return flow [Kirkby, 1988], much ignored in hydrology or used only in a very restrictive sense, is certainly more appropriate: It captures the origin of overland flow in this environment while acknowledging the existence of pipe flow. In as much as K and SiO2 are the characteristic tracers of fast and slow flow paths, respectively,they maybe used implicitly as new-water and old-water signals under the plausible assumption that they are almost exclusively supplied by vegetation and weathering zone, respectively. Vegetation interacts mainly with near-surface fast flow paths in response to precipitation events, so the high K/SiO2 ratio of these flow paths is clearly a result of the event itself. In other words, it is new water. To add to the ''old and new water versusslow and fast pathways'' controversy, our results emphasize the importance of fast pathways transporting new water at La Cuenca. Considering only responsive forested catchments, the Maimai catchments [McDonnell,1990], with fastpathways transmitting old water, represent the other end of the spectrum.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Soil water and groundwater sources alone cannot explain the observed storm flow chemistry in this overland flow-dominated catchment. Hence the correct hydrological pathways cannot be inferred from the stormflow hydrochemical signal alone. We suggest that overland flow be considered a true source of storm flow wherever it can be assumed to be generated at the  soil surface itself, i.e., where its flow lines are not incised. In the latter case, overland flow was shown to be a mixture of subsurface and surface sources, or pre event and event water. Hence in this environment the fast pathway overland flow may transmit pre event or event water. Accordingly, a substantial portion of the stormflow hydrograph can be attributed to pre event water from  sub surface sources, depending on event characteristics and antecedent moisture conditions. Pre event water sources are hillslope groundwater and soil water. The poorly developed chemical zonation of Inceptisols restricts the usefulness of the mixing analysis in identifying the precise source of soil water, although independent hydrometric information implicates a shallow soil layer. The contribution of pre event soil water to the stormflow hydrograph during a low-intensity event is similar to that of other forested headwater catchments, while the contribution of strictly event overland flow appearsto be unique to tropical rain forest catchments.', 'N/A', '2277', 'Conclusions (partial)', 1, '1', 'Forest described', 'Soil types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 176, 219, 176, 1, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Groundwater levels in the Upper Sheep Creek Watershed respond to snowmelt differently depending on the areal extent of snowcover. In early spring, melt from the general snow-covered area causes a groundwater rise throughout the monitored area. Once the general snowcover is gone, snowmelt from the isolated drift drives the hydraulic response of the piezometers, with piezometers further upslope and closer to the drift responding to melt events sooner than piezometers near the bottom of the slope. Response time of piezometers to snowmelt from the isolated drift was found to differ dramatically between two years that had different snow accumulation. During a year with near-normal snow accumulation, response time between piezometers near the toe of the drift and those near the stream channel 70-140 m downslope was approximately 2-3 days. Response time was 32-46 days during a year with snow accumulation approximately 40% of normal. Most of the saturated flow through the hillslope occurs in an altered basalt layer lying between two layers of dense basalt. Based on slug tests conducted by Winkelmaier (1987), hydraulic conductivity of the altered basalt layer is approximately 5x10-4 cms-1 . Assuming the porosity of this layer is 1-5% and given a 20% slope, it would take 15-78 days for water to travel the 135 m between piezometers K7 and G5. This travel time is considerably greater than the 1986 response lag times, but, given the rough approximations, is of the order of travel times observed during the 1987 melt. A conceptual model was hypothesized to explain the large differences in response times between 1986 to 1987. Figure 8 shows the estimated height of the water table in relation to the hydrogeologic zones within a hillslope cross-section. Recharge from the general snowmelt in 1986 was sufficient to fill the altered basalt layer. The overlying semi-dense basalt layer then acted as a confining layer for groundwater flow. Meltwater from the snowdrift entered the altered basalt layer (zone 4) upslope from the semi-dense basalt layer. Excess water formed perched water tables above the semi-dense basalt layer as indicated by piezometers at I6. The rapid response during 1986 was therefore primarily a pressure pulse through the altered basalt layer. Had the semi-dense basalt layer been completely impermeable, response times would be extremely rapid. The conceptual model is further supported by the rapid rise and fall in the piezometers when the water level was above the semi-dense basalt layer, and slow recession when the water level fell below the semi-dense basalt layer (at an elevation of 1890.9 m at K7 in Fig. 4(b)). Because recharge during 1987 was insufficient to fill the altered basalt zone (Fig. 8), response time between piezometers was due to water movement through the system and is indicative of travel time in the zero-order basin.', 'N/A', '307', 'Discussion and Conclusions', 1, '4', 'N', 'N', 'Geological types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 177, 244, 177, 1, 1, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Response of groundwater levels in the Upper Sheep Creek Watershed differs depending on the areal extent of snowcover. In late winter, snow typically covers the entire watershed and melt causes a rise in groundwater levels throughout the monitored area. Once snow has left most of the watershed in early spring, snowmelt from the isolated drift drives the hydraulic response of the basin, with piezometers further upslope and closer to the drift responding to melt events sooner than piezometers near the bottom of the slope. Flerchinger et al. (1992) found that the response time of piezometers to snowmelt from the isolated drift differed quite dramatically depending on the extent of recharge from snowmelt. During years with near-normal snow accumulation, the response time between piezometers near the toe of the drift and those near the stream channel 70-140 m downslope was approximately 2-3 days. The response time was 32-42 days during a year with snow accumulation approximately 40% of normal. Flerchinger et al. (1992) hypothesized a conceptual model to explain the large differences in response times. Recharge from the general snowmelt during years with normal snow accumulation is sufficient to fill the altered basalt layer (zone 4 in Fig. 2), causing the flow to become confined between the dense and semi-dense basalt layers (zones 5 and 3, respectively). The rapid response is therefore primarily a pressure pulse through the altered basalt layer as melt water enters the altered basalt layer (zone 4) upslope from where the semi-dense layer exists. Slower response during years with low snow accumulation results from water movement through the system, and is indicative of travel time through the altered basalt layer.', 'N/A', '204', 'Conceptual model', 1, '4', 'N', 'N', 'Geological types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 178, 244, 178, 1, 1, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Analysis of the streamflow regime at the catchment scale. Overall, the hydrological regime of the URHB follows a distinct non-linear storage–discharge relationship (Fig. S2 of the ESM), suggesting streamflow contributions from multiple storage reservoirs (Martina and Entekhabi 2006). Deep groundwater discharge (baseflow) shows only minor temporal variability and comprises around 50 % of total annual streamflow (Fig. S3 of the ESM). Baseflow-generation can be correlated to the substantial portion of Upper Freshwater Molasse (UFM) that underlies approximately 75 % of the URHB area (Koenig et al. 1994; Vitvar and Balderer 1997). Since water tables are deep in the UFM aquifer with mean residence times of more than 1 year (Heidbüchel et al. 2012; Vitvar and Balderer 1997), the baseflow signal is strongly dampened and not directly affected by climatic forcing (e.g., rainfall, evapotranspiration; Koenig et al. 1994). This assumption is further supported by numerous perennial springs that originate from high-elevation regions of the URHB with underlying UFM. The baseflow component of the hydrograph was estimated with the recursive digital filter technique after Nathan and McMahon (1990) by applying three passing times and a filter parameter of 0.95 to obtain a high degree of smoothing. Average baseflow indices of 0.5 from 1 March to 31 October 2011 and 0.6 from 1 March to 31 October 2012 were obtained, which are in good agreement with the long-term analysis (section 3 of the ESM) and, thus, can be considered representative for the long-term hydrological behavior of the URHB. Streamflow rates above 2.8 mm d−1 (median flow) indicate a more dynamic hydrologic regime (Fig. S3 of the ESM), which is probably driven by rainfall events and the activation of quick groundwater fluxes and surface runoff. Source areas of this event-flow component of the hydrograph can therefore be in the more permeable regions of the landscape adjacent to the river network (i.e., the valley bottom areas underlain by unconsolidated Quaternary GMD) and on saturated or low-permeability soils, respectively (Koenig et al. 1994). Groundwater dynamics at the Büel site. To identify dominant event-flow generating mechanisms in the GMD unit, the variability of water tables in 2011 and 2012 was analyzed with respect to the local surface- and subsurface properties at the Büel site. Figure 3 illustrates that the uppermost piezometer locations are characterized by deeper water tables (z gw) and a larger saturated thickness (z conf  – z gw) compared to the near-stream piezometers (P4, P5, P6, P8). Steeper slopes of z gw-distributions at low cumulative probabilities suggest rather dampened rainfall responses and a slow recession behavior of the water tables at the uphill piezometers (P1, P2, P3). Therefore, slow vertical percolation though the vadose zone and lateral flux through the saturated soil matrix are likely to be the dominant groundwater flow pathways. The near-stream water tables showed a higher temporal variability, as is indicated by steeper slopes of the z gw- and (z conf  – z gw)-distributions in Fig. 3. Further, generally small z gw values suggest the occurrence of full-saturation periods during rainfall events. At P5, the shallowest water tables (z gw(P5) < 0.5 m) occurred 13 % of the time (Fig. 3a). A similar behavior was found for P4, P6 and P8 for z gw < 0.75 m; although, the water table did not reach the land surface. This indicates the existence of a high-transmissivity zone in the upper organic-rich soil layer that facilitates rapid lateral flux of shallow groundwater during rainfall (Dahlke et al. 2012; Lyon et al. 2006). Such high-transmissivity zones can be formed by root channels, animal burrows and partially buried logs (Bachmair and Weiler 2011). In order to investigate such high-transmissivity zones in more detail, infiltration experiments were conducted with a double-ring infiltrometer at 11 plots across the Büel site between 24 June and 5 July 2013 (ASTM 2013; Philip 1957). Measured infiltration rates ranged from 0–2.6E-5 m s−1, with a distinct zone of low permeability at the flat bottom area of the Büel site that is underlain by Gleysol (infiltration rates 0–6.7E-6 m s−1, arithmetic mean 3.7E-6 m s−1, 5 plots). The permeability of the soil increased towards further uphill areas. Near the MET, where Cambisol can be found, infiltration rates were between 1.0E-5 and 2.6E-5 m s−1 (arithmetic mean 1.8E-5 m s−1, 6 plots). This suggests that the storage deficit in the flat bottom area of the Büel site is very small, likely due to capillary rise from the shallow water table and low hydraulic permeability, that does not allow significant infiltration. Consequently, the absolute volume of groundwater recharge from percolating rainwater is presumably very small in this part of the Büel site. Instead, rainfall is likely to cause saturation excess, which triggers instantaneous overland flow and shallow subsurface stormflow in the uppermost soil layer (McGrath et al. 2007). Accordingly, the Büel site can be discretized into the two hydrological landscape units: hillslope (uphill piezometers P1, P2, P3) and riparian zone (near-stream piezometers P5, P6, P7, P8) with piezometer P4 as the transition zone at a distance of 23.3 m from the riverbank. Similarly, the event-flow generating landscape units in the URHB are delineated as follows: relatively flat catchment areas (slopes < 7 °) adjacent to the river network underlain by peaty soils and Gleysols are assigned riparian zones, whereas Cambisols overlying the GMD in the intermediate area of fractured-bedrock aquifer (UFM) and riparian zones are allocated to hillslopes. Thus, riparian zones and hillslopes cover approximately 7.5 % (A rz) and 17.7 % (A h) of the URHB area, respectively. The remaining areal fraction of 74.8 % accounts for strongly damped discharge of deep groundwater (baseflow), which does not contribute to event flow in the applied framework.', 'N/A', '940', 'Dominant flow processes and delineation of hydrological landscape units', 5, '1', 'N', 'Multiple properties described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 179, 186, 179, 9, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'This current study has shown the bedrock to be quite permeable with a structure that promotes bulk water flow and significant storm response in the bedrock aquifer. For the storms monitored, bedrock groundwater did not rise above the soil bedrock interface, and therefore, did not contribute directly to the subsurface lateral stormflow. This interpretation was supported by isotopic evidence showing no deflection in the isotopic signature of bedrock groundwater towards either the soil water (trench water) or precipitation values during a storm event, implying no mixing within the bedrock on the event time frame. Nevertheless, the dynamic response of bedrock water tables on a storm-event time scale (Fig. 3a) offers evidence of bedrock groundwater responsiveness and potential significance at the catchment scale. Indeed if one examines the runoff ratios at the hillslope and catchment scales at Maimai, reported M8 hillslope runoff ratios are on the order of 13% (Woods and Rowe, 1996), while the catchment wide runoff ratio is nearly 60% (Woods and Rowe, 1996). This strong dichotomy suggests that groundwater likely influences stream response independent of shallow, lateral flow paths that have been the focus of so many previous studies at the site (as reviewed by McGlynn et al. (2002)).', '5.1.1', '128', 'Maimai M8', 1, '1', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 180, 137, 181, 1, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Our findings suggest that the bedrock groundwater table does not rise above the soil–bedrock interface and thus, does not contribute directly to lateral subsurface stormflow at the soil bedrock interface. We do have evidence, however, that the very shallow highly fractured bedrock in and around the soil–bedrock interface does exert an influence on runoff processes and contributes directly to lateral subsurface stormflow. We hypothesize that once subsurface stormflow occurs, some portion of the flow is lost as seepage to the fractured bedrock. Once in the bedrock, circulation is controlled by the fracture network density, geometry and connectivity (Banks et al., 2009) and is extremely heterogeneous. Well dynamics shown in Fig. 3b provides evidence of differing flow paths within the fractured bedrock as the water table response between wells are highly variable despite their close proximity. Some flow follows deeper fracture pathways connecting to a deeper bedrock aquifer. This seepage does not play a direct role in the storm event runoff, but instead follows classic groundwater discharge pathways that maintain baseflow conditions (Winter, 2007). Subsurface stormflow that follows shallow bedrock fracture pathways may either remerge at the soil bedrock interface if the fracture pinches out, or may directly bypass to the stream channel depending on the fracture network. In both cases, this water has a direct contribution to storm runoff. Graham et al. (2010a) showed that near surface fractured bedrock constituted a significant flow path in the WS10 hillslope, nearly equal in volume to subsurface lateral flow in the soil during a sprinkler experiment that brought the WS10 instrumented hillslope up to steady state discharge. Highly fractured regions of bedrock can act to either prevent saturation due to highly transmissive fractures that transport water rapidly downslope, or augment saturation at the soil bedrock interface by acting as an exfiltration zone which transports and concentrates water from upslope regions to downslope regions. Similar findings have been reported by others. For example, Uchida et al. (2002) determined that exfiltrating bedrock groundwater was an important contributor to transient groundwater in upper hillslope regions in a zero-order catchment in Central Japan. Wilson and Dietrich (1987) noted that bedrock return flow occurred where fractured bedrock encountered a competent zone that forced flow back up into the subsoil, creating a transient saturated zone. Montgomery et al. (2002) and Anderson et al. (1997) found that return flow from bedrock created zones of transient saturation at the soil bedrock interface, and deeper bedrock pathways carried tracers rapidly through the subsurface to the channel head. Considering the heterogeneity of fractured bedrock, it is possible to conceive of a patchy network of saturated zones in upslope regions that are in part, controlled by the underlying bedrock. Saturated zones would occur on top of more competent regions, while unsaturated zone would occur over fractured regions. The hillslope would then display variably saturated conditions depending on rainfall amount, intensity, and antecedent conditions, similar to what both Harr (1977) and McGuire and McDonnell (2010) reported. The isotope time series (Fig. 6b) shows Well B4, the trench and the stream all shifting away from the rain input signal towards lighter isotopic values immediately prior to the hydrograph peak. Although we cannot directly identify the water source that is causing this shift (although we hypothesize that it is unmeasured soil water/vadose water end member), we are able to rule out event water as the source of water into the bedrock.', '5.1.2', '130', 'H.J.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The highest threshold responses observed in this study were in midslope positions, while the lowest occurred near the top and bottom of hillslopes. Typical podzols, which had the highest response thresholds, dominated the catchment, accounting for an estimated 50% of the catchment area [Gillin, 2013] and primarily occurred along midslope positions. While E and Bhs podzols almost always occurred together on the landscape, they were also almost always separated from hillslope Bh podzols by typical podzols (Figure 2). Hillslope and near-stream Bh podzols were likewise sometimes separated from each other by typical podzols. This paints a picture of stormflow generation via a spatial patchwork of water table occurrence within the solum, and therefore lateral subsurface flow in the solum of the catchment, rather than an uninterrupted saturated area extending up from streams. A system such as this highlights the importance of the active versus contributing areas of Ambroise [2004]. For example, water tables occurred in E and Bhs podzols far from the stream at frequently exceeded thresholds of catchment storage necessary for water table occurrence. Furthermore, there are large areas of the catchment separating E and Bhs podzols from the stream that only had water tables in the solum during extreme events (typical podzols). While portions of E and Bhs podzol areas may connect with intermittent or ephemeral channels, in many cases water tables occur upslope and infiltrate to deeper storage before the areas of saturation reach a stream channel. When water from these soils does enter stream channels, it often flows into portions of the stream network where the stream is surrounded by typical podzols, likely indicating the stream is losing water to surrounding soils. During larger events, when thresholds are exceeded in typical podzols, E and Bhs podzols are more likely to connect to the stream (Figure 1). Therefore, if water tables connected to the stream channel generate stormflow, there are active areas in the catchment that are not contributing areas unless a high threshold of catchment storage is exceeded. However, water in these areas is moving further downward into the C horizon. Water in the C horizon may take one of several paths to the stream network. While generally lower conductivity [Detty and McGuire, 2010b], the C horizon in WS3 has been shown to be heterogeneous, with lenses of higher conductivity material [Bailey et al., 2014]. Furthermore, preliminary ground penetrating radar results have shown the C horizon to be 0–9 m thick. Therefore, most water entering the C horizon will take a slower flow path to the stream, recharging the larger C horizon groundwater reservoir. However, as high conductivity areas of till are present throughout the catchment, there also exists the possibility of groundwater following such a pathway to the stream. Some water moving from water tables in E and Bhs podzols into the C horizon may contribute flow to streams in this way. Other authors have discussed discontinuous active areas on hillslopes [McNamara et al., 2005; Spence, 2010; Stieglitz et al., 2003]. Furthermore, as distance from the stream increases, some authors have found a decreased correlation of groundwater levels with streamflow [Haught and van Meerveld, 2011; Penna et al., 2014; Seibert et al., 2003]. The spatial patchwork of solum water table occurrence in WS3 is consistent with the behavior presented in these other studies. However, we have identified an integrative characteristic (i.e., hydropedological unit) that is consistently indicative of water table behavior. Looking at the catchment through this lens provides a framework for mapping continuous/discontinuous water table occurrence in the solum of the catchment through time. As mentioned above, the role of discontinuous water tables in generating streamflow is currently unknown, as is their potential influence on stream chemistry. However, the insights offered in this study may provide an approach to more closely investigate the effects of patchy regions of subsurface saturation located throughout a catchment. In addition to being a useful tool for examining the role of discontinuous solum water tables, our findings may be useful for examining the evolution of contributing area throughout events. Our observations are consistent with others suggesting distinct hydrologic regimes in near-stream areas [Cirmo and McDonnell, 1997; McGlynn and Seibert, 2003; Ocampo et al., 2006]. We detected persistent water tables in near-stream Bh podzols with lower magnitude water fluctuations, presumably the result of higher saturated hydraulic conductivity in the near-stream zone [Detty and McGuire, 2010b]. Upslope of these soils was almost always typical podzols, which our threshold analysis has shown to have very infrequent water table incursion into the solum. Therefore, the observation of persistent water tables in the near-stream zone and typical podzols immediately upslope is consistent with the majority of event water being mobilized from the near-stream zone [McGlynn and McDonnell, 2003]. A direct connection between hillslope groundwater and the stream likely only occurs during large events, where water tables occur in the lower portion of typical podzol profiles. The discontinuities evident from our analysis suggest most hillslope water takes longer, deeper flow paths to the stream, likely through the glacial parent material of the C-horizon.', '5.3', '8415', 'Implications for Runoff Generation', 3, '2', 'N', 'Multiple properties described', 'Geological types described', 'Topography described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 182, 266, 182, 2, 3, 2),

The Bruntland Burn is a typical upland catchment in northwestern Europe (e.g., Birkel et al., 2010), namely a combination of steep and rolling hillslopes and over-widened valley bottoms due to the glacial legacy of this region. The valley bottom areas are covered by deep (in parts >30 m) glacial drift deposits (e.g., till) containing a large amount of stored water superimposed on a relatively impermeable granitic solid geology (Soulsby et al., 2016). Peat soils developed (>1 m deep) in these valley bottom areas, which remain saturated throughout most of the year with a dominant near-surface runoff generation mechanism delivering runoff quickly via micro-topographical flow pathways connected to the stream network (Soulsby et al., 2015). Brown rankers, peaty rankers and peat soils are responsible for a flashy hydrological regime driven by saturation excess overland flow, while humus iron podzols on the hillslopes do not favor near-surface saturation but rather facilitate groundwater recharge through vertical water movement (Tetzlaff et al., 2014). Land use is dominated by heather moorland, with smaller areas of rough grazing and forestry on the lower hillslopes. Its annual precipitation is 1059 mm, with the summer months (May–August) generally being the driest (Ali et al., 2014). Snow makes up less than 10 % of annual precipitation and melts rapidly below 500 m. The evapotranspiration is around 400 mm per year and annual discharge around 659 mm. The daily precipitation, potential evaporation, and discharge data range from 1 January 2008 to 30 September 2014. The calibration period is from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2010, and the data from 1 January 2011 to 30 September 2014 is used as validation. The LiDAR-derived DEM map with 2 m resolution shows elevation ranging from 250 to 539 m (Fig. 6). There are seven saturation area maps (Fig. 7) (2 May, 2 July, 4 August, 3 September, 1 October, 26 November 2008, and 21 January 2009), measured directly by the “squishy boot” method and field mapping by the global positioning system (GPS), to delineate the boundary of saturation areas connected to the stream network (Birkel et al., 2010; Ali et al., 2014).

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Return flow was another mechanism of overland flow generation that could be observed in the forest and pasture, but the underlying processes differed between catchments. During perched water conditions return flow is difficult to separate from saturation overland flow. After saturation overland flow ceased return flow might substantially contribute to baseflow. The March 6, 2005 event was the only one during which forest baseflow (0.64 mm) exceeded pasture baseflow (0.25 mm) (Fig. 7). Fast return flow through macropores was not observed for the first stormflow event on March 5, 2005 in the forest, but only at the end of the second stormflow event on March 6, 2005, when forest baseflow exceeded that in pasture (personal observation). Return flow in the forest is, hence, attributed to fast return flow through macropores. In contrast, frequent upward water flow in the middle nest of the midslope transect in the pasture indicated slow lateral subsurface stormflow and return flow. For this event, the contribution of return flow to total stormflow was smaller for pasture than for forest due to low near-surface conductivities in the pasture. Baseflow observed long after perched water conditions was, however, attributed to groundwater flow and was more common in the pasture than in the forest. Stormflow tended to start simultaneously in both catchments, but it rose more rapidly in the pasture during times of near-surface groundwater levels. This indicates that saturation excess caused by rainfall on an area of groundwater table emergence (return flow) (Dunne and Black, 1970a, Dunne and Black, 1970b) expanded faster in the pasture than in the forest during rainfall events. In addition to insights into land-use change impacts on stormflow generation, this study demonstrates that two different VSA processes can occur at the same site. The process behind the VSA concept, as described by Hewlett and Hibbert (1967), is linked to near steam areas with high soil water content or shallow groundwater levels but it can coexist with a VSA process of runoff generation driven by saturation excess over impeding layers. In both cases the source areas expand with increasing rainfall volume and intensity.', 'N/A', '479', 'Land-use effect on stormflow generation', 2, '1', 'Multiple land-covers described', 'Soil hydraulic properties described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'Uncertainty described', 'N', 184, 70, 184, 8, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Water tables generally were observed to be shallowest in bog areas and deepest on productive slopes. Saturated hydraulic conductivity determined by bail tests ranged from 10-4 to 10-7 cm/s. Weak downward hydraulic gradients were also observed in hillslope areas and upward gradients were observed near localized seeps and tributary channels. From basic physical monitoring and observation it was found that groundwater flow pathways are typically fairly short, with seep flow contributing most groundwater to streamflow via channelized pathways. Depression storage is commonly observed even during dry periods, but its occurrence during these times is largely restricted to the bog and bog-forest zones. During dry periods, depression storage is encountered on forested hillslopes only for brief intervals during peak runoff. Depression storage occurs throughout the bog±forest complex during wetter periods in autumn and winter. [...] The role of groundwater in the runo regime of hypermaritime bog±forest complexes of the Prince Rupert region has not been investigated previously. From basic observations we can conclude that water reaching the ground surface passes through the subsurface along short flow pathways that terminate in local rills or seeps. The prevalence of low hydraulic conductivity organic soil promotes shallow water tables and selectively reduces the rate of groundwater movement in deeper organic soils below about 0.5 m depth. This condition appears to limit interaction between bedrock and shallow groundwater, resulting in geochemically dilute waters and runoff. Drainage from the slopes occurs primarily via channelized flow in seepage tracks, often deeply incised, that typically are connected to the main stream channel. Water with the distinct isotopic signature of shallow groundwater flow also has been observed at the bedrock interface, and is attributed to the presence of vertical bypass structures created by buried deadfall and/or root holes, although these have not been widely observed. The groundwater regime within bedrock has not been investigated, but recharge is expected to occur from the overlying organic layers, especially in the bog-filled depressions, owing to the fractured character of the rock mass. Bonell et al. (1998) describe analogous hydrological and isotopic responses in high-rainfall response-dominated tropical forested catchments of New Zealand and Australia with shallow soils (<3 m) overlying bedrock. At low rainfall intensities (<250 mm/day), they observed that water generally is routed to streamflow via the soil-groundwater system, which can be predominantly characterized as a first-in-first-out system, i.e. streamflow is dominated by old water. At high rainfall intensities (<250 mm/day), however, the flow capacity of these pathways is exceeded and alternative pathways involving rapid flow (i.e. rill and seep flow) are invoked, resulting in last-in-first-out behaviour, i.e. streamflow is dominated by new water. They concluded that these steep, flashy hydrological systems with shallow soils (3 m) overlying bedrock are well-represented by an ideal non-linear storage model that is comprised of a shallow, quick flow reservoir coupled to a deep slow flow reservoir (figure 11.19 in Bonell et al., 1998). This study indicates that a similar conceptual model may apply to temperate rainforests characterized by bog-forest vegetation. Although soil layers are considerably shallower in the present setting, variations in the organic content of soil, and variations in the depth of soils combine to produce considerable variability in water residence times in various terrain units within the watershed. Based on the studies of Bonell et al. (1998) it is probable that high intensity events (not observed in this study) may be characterized by a shift or perhaps a reversal in old and new water contributions.  Further physical monitoring and isotope hydrograph separation analysis will be required to refine and improve on this conceptual model of runoff generation.

Snow-melt occurred earlier here than on permafrost slopes, with no observed overland or subsurface flow. A deep water table (> 3.4 m) within clay to silty clay would further indicate only minor potential for deeper groundwater flow. On permafrost slopes, snowmelt occurred during 15 April to 1 May (Julian Day 105-120). Shallow active-layer water sampled in monitoring wells during the melt period was found to have d180 and d2H values intermediate between late-season active-layer water (old water) and snow (new water), suggesting mixing of these components. Rapid rise in water tables within the shallow active layer (= 0.15 m) resulted in runoff via overland flow (flow in rills between saturated depressions), and pipe flow (flow in 5-10 cm diameter, 1-10 m long frost cracks situated at or above the mineral soillorganic layer contact). The characteristics of overland flow and pipe flow were comparable to those described in previous studies in similar environments (Woo 1988, Woo and diCenzo 1988). The timing of overland flow discharge from a small runoff plot is shown in Fig. 3. Although no pipe flow measurements were made, the timing and isotopic similarity of pipe flow and overland flow suggests a similar generation mechanism. d180 and d2H values of overland flow and pipe flow were found to be heavier than snowpack values, indicating a significant old-water content (Table 2). QN/QT evaluated from Eq. (1) indicates that 50 to 60 % of instantaneous overland and pipe flow discharge is derived from over-winter active-layer storage (i.e. water existing prior to snow-melt). Evidently, mixing of snowmelt and in situ water occurred in the shallow active layer. As storage capacities were exceeded in the early freshet period, old and new water were delivered to the tributary by surface routes and shallow sub-surface routes in pipe structures. Following cessation of overland and pipe flow, the isotopic composition of streamflow rapidly returned to baseflow values. In light of the isotopic similarity between tributary baseflow and late season active-layer waters, replenishment of the tributary during quiescent periods was evidently occurring via the active-layer soil matrix. Visual observations during a rainy period in the later thaw season revealed that overland and pipe flow pathways had reactivated, however no detailed isotopic sampling was conducted during this time (see Fig. 3).', 'N/A', '221', 'Runoff Sources and Pathway', 2, '4', 'N', 'Soil types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 186, 140, 186, 8, 1, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The major processes identified include on-channel precipitation and near-channel overland flow, which are thought to be important sources of direct snowmelt and rainfall runoff. In unsaturated off-channel areas infiltration capacity is often too high for these processes to occur. In wetlands, mixed water sources are delivered to the stream via fill and spill, which involves event water raising the groundwater table until depression storage is satisfied and then flow occurs. Macropore flow involves flow of mixed water predominantly through organic soils and interflow/return flows are shallow groundwaters that flow between mineral soil and peat, contributing either to fill and spill or macropore flow. The fill and spill process also applies to larger bodies of surface water including lakes and ponds that are often connected by permanent outlets to the tributaries. Flow from these sources is isotopically labelled as surface water due to exposure to evaporative isotopic enrichment. Groundwater sources also include shallow flow in drift aquifers and deeper sources, including bedrock aquifers or regional groundwater. In general, the residence time of water increases from runoff component (1) through to (8) (see Fig. 12). Deeper groundwater sources also tend to be more important lower down in the drainage network as the channels become more incised, in places within bedrock. If groundwater ridging is occurring in the watersheds, then it must lead to interaction with organic soils, otherwise we would not see increases in both groundwater and surface water contributions during the freshet or during rain events. Translatory flows appear to dominate runoff. Microtopography (hollows and hummocks) in organic terrain is important in the fill and spill process because it promotes subsurface interactions (Frei et al., 2010) and translatory flows. The fate of event water, if it does not fall in near-channel areas, is to become mixed with groundwater if recharged, or surface water if it lands on saturated wetlands and is exposed to evaporation.', '4', '144', 'Discussion', 2, '1', 'N', 'Multiple properties described', 'N', 'Topography described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 187, 12, 187, 8, 2, 2),

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'To study the characteristics of four rainfall events, we can clearly find that the rainfall intensity has a significant temporal change. In the process of rainfall events, the rain intensity is less than the infiltration capacity at some times and sometimes greater than the infiltration capacity. When rainfall intensity is greater than soil infiltration capacity, excess infiltration will occur in places where the soil water content reached the saturated moisture content, which will increase the proportion of event water to the total discharge in the channel (storm 1). Rainfall intensity of storm 2 is the smallest that will result in the raindrops in the ground infiltrating along the vertical section of the soil layer. Infiltration of the event water will replace the pre-event water in the unsaturated or saturated zone, making the percentage of pre-event water contribution to discharge larger, and precipitation relative to the watershed water storage capacity can be ignored, so the event water cannot completely replace the pre-event water. The remaining event water contribution of 1.7% in storm 2 may be mainly due to the direct rainfall onto the channel or impervious surface which will rapidly collect to a watershed export as event water. The contribution of pre-event water also related to the characteristics of landscape organization. Hemuqiao experimental watershed is located in the humid mountainous area of Southeast China, which has a relatively thin thickness of unsaturated zone (1.5–2.5 m) and high permeable soil covered well with plants. The main runoff generation pattern of this region is repletion of storage, which means that runoff is generated until soil moisture reaches field capacity, and the excess rainfall will flow out of the watershed as event water. However, this theory may be not used to reveal the runoff process in mountainous watershed covered with bamboo. Storm 2 has relatively wet antecedent condition and shows the highest proportion of pre-event water which indicates that the growth and development of plant roots might probably result in macropore flow being widespread in bamboo forest soil. Hemuqiao watershed is covered mainly by bamboo (90%), and the rest is covered by potato, tea and other crops.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Both isotopic signal and hydrochemical tracers showed dominance of pre-event water at the typhoon event, whether the streamflow is large or small. Such fraction of pre-event water may be due to a similar mechanism which controls the formation of summer and autumn runoff. The antecedent condition and the rain intensity may play an important role in the process of runoff. This watershed is different from the process of hydrology in humid tropical montane watersheds, in which rapid translation of rainfall to streamflow primarily controlled by overland flow and interflow (Bonell 2005). The Hemuqiao watershed belongs to the humid watershed, and the runoff components primarily include surface flow, interflow, and ground flow. However, this study separates the base flows that are based on the method of one-tracer two-component hydrograph analysis. Our research results show that the shallow lateral flow are not a dominant way of hillslope and basin rain response in the Hemuqiao watershed. Two components of the hydrological separation analysis by using hydrochemical and conservative isotope both show that the pre-event water contribute in excess of 60% of the streamflow. The similar result of four rainfall events affirms that base flow plays a role in recharging streamflow during rainfall events. For example, storm 1 has a relatively high rainfall intensity of 5.12  mm/h, and the contribution of pre-event water is the smallest in the total typhoon rainfall events. However, the pre-event water still accounted for a large part of the streamflow (67.7%), suggesting that the vertical seepage of the rainfall through the highly permeable volcanic soil cannot be neglected. In the process of rainfall event, the rain intensity is less than the infiltration capacity at some time and sometimes is greater than the infiltration capacity. When rainfall intensity is greater than soil infiltration capacity, excess infiltration will occur in places where the soil water content reached the saturated moisture content, which will increase the proportion of event water to the total discharge in the channel. Taking into account the hydrograph separations, overland flow is not sufficient to explain the contribution of event water from the results of two-component separations. Recharging the groundwater is the importance of the hydrological process. It controls the value, lag time, and the composition of EC and isotopic content of the streamflow in typhoon events. A small amount of surface water moves through the drainage system over a few hours, but the contribution of groundwater discharge through permeable soil is not expected to be negligible. Further, a large amount of water stored in soil and groundwater is expected to have a significant impact on streamflow.', 'N/A', '7', 'Different Types of Runoff Response in Hemuqiao Watershed', 1, '1', 'N', 'Soil types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 193, 90, 193, 1, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Using available soil and topography information for the catchment (DEW, 2016; Hall et al., 2009; DEWNR, 2016), we first developed a conceptual model to outline the most likely processes leading to streamflow generation and the resulting dominant streamflow generation for Pedler Creek (Table 2). We identified the following three major areas with distinctive characteristics: (1) the steep hills to the east, (2) the undulating hills to the north, and (3) the flat valley in the southwestern area of the catchment (Fig. 3a). These three areas provide a spatial understanding of the most likely streamflow generating processes, with different processes and areas of the catchment contributing to the short ephemeral flows during summer and late fall, the early winter buildup to intermittent flow, and, throughout the rainy season, continuous flow. A detailed description of the processes for each area and the spatiotemporal development of the most likely dominant streamflow generation component for intermittent flow is provided below (Fig. 3b–d).\n2.2.1 Steep hills; fast flow\nThe steep hills are characterised by a permeable and shallow (top 0.5 m) loam soil underlain by a heavy clay profile with steep slopes (Fig. 3b). The combination of the shallow loam soil permeability, the high infiltration capacity, and the steep slopes are likely to allow the water to infiltrate and to flow relatively fast as unsaturated IF towards the stream (Fig. 3b1–2). We hypothesise that the shallow loam soil profile and the water holding capacity of the loam will promote a perched GW mounding along the riverine area, which will result in SE-OF from the riverine area and the adjacent hillslope developing as the dominant streamflow generation mechanism (Fig. 3b3). We hypothesise that this area contributes heavily to the temporally isolated ephemeral flows and the dominant flow generation mechanism for these events would be infiltration excess overland flow.\n2.2.2 Undulating hills; slow flow\nThe undulating hills consist of a highly permeable deep (top 1.1 m) sandy soil profile underlain by a heavy clay layer with mild slopes (Fig. 3b). We expect that the high soil infiltration capacity and permeability of the sand will result in a large infiltration rate allowing most of the early winter precipitation to infiltrate in this area (Fig. 3c4; Blasch et al., 2006; Batlle-Aguilar and Cook, 2012; Mihevc et al., 2002). As the infiltrated water reaches the low permeable clay layer, it will move in the subsurface as IF towards the low-gradient areas (Fig. 3c5). We hypothesise that the high infiltration rates in combination with the mild slopes (or low-gradient areas in the valley) will favour the development of a perched GW that will rise uniformly, allowing the river to develop into a gaining condition. As the infiltrated water moves as IF it will discharge into the downstream areas (Fig. 3c6). Due to the larger unsaturated storage and the mild slopes, this area will likely take longer to contribute to flow (i.e. more water and, therefore, more time will be needed to reach the threshold of flow generation). We hypothesise that these areas will therefore provide the slow flows necessary to sustain intermittent flow for the days without rainfall during the intermittent season, and conversely, they are not likely to contribute to flow during ephemeral events (Fig. 3e).\n2.2.3 Flat valley; mixed flows\nThe flat valley comprises a mix of the previous two soil profiles (deep sand and shallow loam underlain by heavy clay) and a heavy clay area, all located in a low-gradient topography (Fig. 3d). The GW becomes shallower near the riverine areas in the valley and depth to GW decreases towards the outlet area (the bore with the shallowest GW is located near the outlet where the GW is ∼ 2 m below surface elevation). This zone has the largest draining area with both the steep and undulating hills draining towards it. The diversity of conditions in this area is likely to result in a combination of the processes previously discussed and additional ones. We hypothesise that the processes originating in the sandy soil areas in the valley will be similar to those on the undulating hills, with the difference that the unsaturated IF that might originate early during the season might only contribute with a small amount of flow that might reflect further downstream. We also expect to see some saturated/unsaturated IF originating early in the season in the loam areas in the valley (Fig. 3d.8–9). However, we hypothesise that the low-gradient terrain, along with the water holding capacity of the loam soil, will slow down water moving as interflow and rather promote the soil saturation to build up in the shallow soil profile. As the saturation increases, we expect the dominant streamflow generation mechanism will switch to saturation excess overland flow from both the hillslope and the river area.\nThe clay''s low permeability will limit infiltration and favour water to pond on the surface on the clay areas, which will eventually result in infiltration excess overland flow (Fig. 3d10–11​​​​​​​). The large draining area of the valley, combined with the low-gradient topography, is likely to promote the development of a perched GW along the riverine area, which will result in SE-OF along some sections of the river (Fig. 3d9). During wet years, sections of the creek near the outlet where GW is shallow are likely to develop into a gaining state with old GW contributing to streamflow (Fig. 3d10). Once the saturation threshold has been met along the riverine area in the steep hills and throughout the loam areas in the valley, SE-OF from those areas and the IE-OF from the clay are likely to contribute with the fast flows as travel times for overland flow are generally smaller than those for subsurface processes (Fig. 3b).', '2.2', '4303', 'Conceptual model of streamflow generation process in Pedler Creek', 3, '3', 'N', 'Multiple properties described', 'N', 'Topography described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 194, 172, 194, 4, 1, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Based on the results presented so far, a coherent picture of stormflow mechanisms at the Conventwald basin can be drawn. This relies on two structural units: (1) a near-channel reservoir, controlling the release of water during the event via its hydraulic potential; (2) a hillslope aquifer, serving predominantly as a baseflow recharge system (Figure 11). Dry antecedent conditions may restrain the near-channel area of fast runoff production to the valley floors. This area expands upslope under wet conditions, which may favour an intensified displacement and release of soil water, because the hydraulic dynamics of the hillslope aquifer are most developed at a high degree of saturation. Temporally the event-related runoff production is divisible into three steps, according to the recession analyses, the occurrence of distinct components in runoff and the chemographs.\nStage 1. Stage 1 (Figure 11), comprises the period between the fast and steep rise of the hydrograph and peak flow. Saturation overland flow (Dunne, 1978) from limited areas on the valley floors is assumed to be the initiating mechanism. Contribution of the direct runoff component to total stormflow runoff is supported by the characteristic ‘event’ related (i.e. isotopic signature similar to throughfall) isotope values (Figure 8b) as well as by the potassium peak at the beginning of event D (Figure 10). The second main flow component during the first section of stormflow generation is ‘old’ water, characterized by high dissolved silica concentrations and a smoothed variation in 18 O content (Figure 8b). Because of its fast release, water contribution from a near-channel reservoir within the basin is supposed, situated in the Quaternary gravel of the valley bottom. To explain the steep rise of the hydrograph a rapid change in the hydraulic conditions inside this reservoir must occur. Similar phenomena were described as groundwater ridging (Sklash and Farvolden, 1979), assuming a distinct capillary fringe, which unlikely exists in the coarse gravel of the Conventwald basin’s valley floor. McGlynn et al. (1999) experimentally demonstrated strong upward discharge gradients at the near-channel riparian zone during snowmelt in a temperate headwater catchment, referred to as ‘transmissivity feedback’ (Bishop, 1991). A similar mechanism could be envisaged for the drastic change of hydraulic conditions in the near-channel area of the Conventwald basin. The thickness of redoximorphic soil horizons might indicate the vertical zone involved in transmissivity feedback during stormflow situations. As one initiating mechanism for an instant replenishment of the near-channel reservoir, fast infiltration along macropores is conceivable, as suggested by distinct shifts of DOC concentration (Figure 10) in total runoff (Peters et al., 1995). A second probable mechanism is the displacement of water of the unsaturated soil zone by infiltrating precipitation. In view of the downslope-decreasing vertical distance of redoximorphic horizons to the ground surface, a high degree of saturation in the near-channel area can be expressed. Supplemented by sufficiently intensive throughfall events this combination may lead to a drastic increase in transmissivity as the saturated zone thickens, resulting in a fast mobilization and displacement of soil water (McGlynn et al., 1999). This first has to pass the near-channel reservoir before being released to runoff, and therefore does not occur in the basin outflow until the recession limb of the hydrograph (Figure 8b). For a single precipitation–runoff event the hillslopes are unlikely to contribute significantly to the system response beyond their pre-event status, according to the hydrometric data (Figure 5b) and the very low runoff coefficients (see ‘Hydrometric data’).\nStage 2. Stage 2 of stormflow generation (Figure 11) comprises peak flow and the subsequent fast depletion of the near-channel reservoir. Direct runoff abates within the first or second day after precipitation has ceased (Figure 8b). Afterwards the reservoir outflow tends towards the average discharge, expressed by a recurring recession coefficient with a t1/2 of 4.3 days (Table I). Total runoff then consists mainly of soil water supplemented by the groundwater component. The isotopic signature of total runoff does not yet indicate a thorough mixing with groundwater, which entered the system formerly (Figure 8b). This isotopic pattern of total runoff is reflected by low concentrations of the geochemicals dissolved silica and sulphate (Figures 8b and 10), a finding also reported from other basins (Hooper and Shoemaker, 1986; Hildebrand et al., 1997). Because of a relatively slow water transfer from the hillslopes to the fast depleting groundwater reservoir, the hillslopes are assumed still not to contribute significantly to the system response during stage 2. Despite the integrated nature of hillslope–floodplain systems (Dunne, 1978), specific changes in tracer concentrations and recession characteristics provide a reason for segregating a third stage in the stormflow generation process. \nStage 3. The third stage (Figure 11) of stormflow generation is characterized by a stable contribution of the soil water component (Figure 8b) and might be initiated by an abrupt drop of the hydraulic potential at the near-channel reservoir. Recession analyses show a clear and recurring point of transition towards a second characteristic reservoir outflow with an average t1/2 of 9Ð9 days (Table I). This transition point presumably indicates the gradual onset of the hillslope aquifer’s system response, resulting in a higher flow activity at the soil–bedrock interface. Dissolved silica and sulphate in total runoff reach levels close to the pre-event status (Figures 8b and 10), while isotope values still point to the contribution of soil water (Figure 8b). The third stage of stormflow generation, therefore, is characterized basically by an increased recharge activity of the hillslope aquifer towards the groundwater reservoir.', 'N/A', '196', 'Integrated conceptual model of stormflow and runoff generation', 2, '3', 'N', 'Soil types described', 'N', 'Topography described', 'N', 'Multiple interpretations demonstrated', 'N', 195, 46, 195, 2, 6, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Spatial flow variability. Studies of runoff generation in interior Alaska (Dingman 1971, 1973, Kane et al. 1981 ) suggest that the extent of permafrost exerts a strong control on the open-water-season hydrologic response of small watersheds. Kane et al. (1981) studied the differences in runoff processes between permafrost-underlain and permafrost-free soils in Glenn Creek and found that permafrost underlain soils contributed the major portion of spring runoff. During winter the organic layer over these soils provides a moisture supply for vertical transport upward to the snowpack, increasing its water equivalent. The organic mat becomes dessicated over the winter, so during snowmelt, water from the snowpack may be used to satisfy its moisture deficit instead of becoming runoff (Santeford 1978, Slaughter and Kane 1978, Kane et al. 1981). In permafrost areas the poorly drained mineral soils under this mat often cause ice-rich conditions to develop in the vicinity of streams and valley bottoms. The ice restricts drainage, so that once the organic mat moisture deficit is satisfied, water in these areas moves downslope through the mat to the stream. On the other hand, soils in permafrost-free areas are moderately well drained (even when frozen), so water can infiltrate them once the organic mat moisture deficit has been satisfied. No overland flow will occur until the infiltration capacity of these soils is exceeded. Kane et al. (1981) observed no overland flow on permafrost-free, south-facing slopes, indicating that this rarely occurs (Dingman 1971). As a result, permafrost-free soils contribute little to runoff during snowpack ablation. [...] Thus, most of the differences in response between C-2 and C-3 appear to be attributable to the percentage of permafrost in the two watersheds. The plots of the data for Glenn Creek, with 68.5% permafrost, are essentially parallel to those for C-3, in spite of the considerably lower relief ratio and drainage density of Glenn Creek. Response differences between C-2 and C-3 indicate that the variable-source-area process may be operating as suggested by Dingman(1971) for Glenn Creek. If so, the restricted drainage due to permafrost results in more wide-spread saturated and nearly saturated zones and thus more overland flow in C-3, as reflected in Figure 14. To the extent that Hortonian overland flow occurs, the more widespread poorly drained soils in C-3 may also result in more overland flow to the channel. The widespread permafrost on slopes and beneath the channel in C-3 may result in much smaller groundwater contributions and lower base flows than in C-2, as shown in Figure 14. [...] This analysis suggests that the hydrologic response of small watersheds in central Alaska is strongly controlled by permafrost. When permafrost underlies a significant portion of a watershed and is present beneath most stream channels, the streanflow peaks in response to rainstorms will be relatively high, and the base flows between storms will be relatively low. Watersheds with little permafrost will have lower peaks and higher sustained base flows per unit area.', 'N/A', '19', 'Spatial flow variability', 2, '2', 'N', 'Soil types described', 'N', 'Topography described', 'N', 'Uncertainty described', 'N', 196, 31, 196, 8, 1, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'As derived from hydrometrical data and sprinkler experiments, runoff processes in our study were significantly influenced by the layered subsurface and the preexisting soil moisture (cf. Badoux et al. 2006; Bronstert et al. 2012). Therefore, different flow pathways of water are activated in the layered subsurface depending on antecedent soil moisture. This leads to different reactions in the gaining stream on its part, which is comparable to the findings of Kleber and Schellenberger (1998) and Chifflard et al. (2008) in shale catchments. We identified three pre-moisture controlled types of runoff processes in the headwater under study (Fig. 8), which is covered by layered periglacial sediments. 1. With low pre-moisture (Fig. 8a), vertical infiltration predominates along preferential flow paths such as root remnants in the LH and in the LM. Water is predominantly fixed by capillary force. Short rises of discharge are generated by saturation overland flow in the spring bog and, possibly, by small-scale lateral flow from the near-spring LB. The runoff coefficient is around 0.1 %. 2. Under intermediate antecedent soil moisture conditions (Fig. 8b), saturation overland flow dominates initially in the spring bog and causes short discharge rises. Thereafter, the LM becomes saturated because of reduced vertical percolation into the LB. Subsequently, the wetting front proceeds deeper through the upper LB, and interflow occurs, which induces a second, continuing discharge increase. The runoff coefficient is around 4 %. 3. With high pre-moisture (Fig. 8c), precipitation or snow melt water percolates rapidly from the LH through the LM, and into the upper part of the LB, because of an increased runoff efficiency. Anisotropic hydraulic properties of the LB induce lateral water flux in the upper part of this layer. Interflow from the hillslope concentrates in the central axis of the slope depression near the spring (Fig. 8d), and therewith heavy water supply from the slope reaches the deeper LB close to the spring. Thus, near-stream perched water expands, water rises up into overlying layers, and return flow occurs causing a long-lasting spring discharge. The runoff coefficient is 14–35 %.', 'N/A', '943', 'Synthesis', 3, '3', 'Wetland described', 'Soil hydraulic properties described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 197, 73, 197, 6, 5, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'For the investigated areas with predominating podzoluvisols, we postulate the following hypothesis on the essential processes of runoff generation due to snowmelt (compare Fig. 7): in summer, with negative soil water balance, macropores and hence preferential flow paths are formed due to clay shrinkage in the upper Bt-horizon and in its (diagnostic) interlocking area with the E-horizon. A deeper saturated soil reservoir (excess water typically occurring in podzoluvisols) is filled by infiltrating precipitation water. In autumn, the size of macro-pores is reduced due to wetting of the soil and clay swelling. However, due to typical tonguing of the E-horizon (coarser grained material) into the Bt-horizon, the discussed soil area remains more or less permeable. During winter, this soil state is conserved. Therefore, infiltrating snowmelt water in spring is more or less retained in upper soil horizons before it enters into the saturated reservoir. In an advanced infiltration stage, water is displaced from the saturated reservoir due to hydraulic  connection to infiltration water and pressure transmission.', '3', '117', 'Modelling of snowmelt and spring flood events', 1, '3', 'N', 'Multiple properties described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 198, 116, 198, 1, 1, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Hydrological processes in the boreal forest of Alaska are dominated by the presence or absence of permafrost. [...] Ice-rich permafrost has very low infiltration capacity preventing percolation of soil moisture to subpermafrost groundwater; consequently soils above permafrost typically have much higher moisture content (Figure la) as compared to neighboring soils in permafrost free areas (Figure Ib) (Bolton et al., 2000). Soils above permafrost also tend to have thicker organic layers as decomposition is decreased with lower temperatures and anaerobic conditions. Soils above permafrost also respond differently to precipitation events due to limited storage capacity. The highly porous near -surface mosses saturate and drain quickly while the deeper mineral soils remain saturated throughout the year. The extent of permafrost within a watershed also markedly impacts streamflow patterns. If one compares outflow hydrographs of three watersheds with differing proportions of permafrost, one can see a predictable pattern. C2, C3 and C4 are the names of three sub-basins of the Caribou Creek watershed in CPCRW. C2 (LoP) is the most permafrost free watershed with only 3.5% permafrost and a watershed area of 5.2 km 2. C3 (HiP) is the most permafrost dominated watershed with 53.2% permafrost and a watershed area of 5.7 km 2• C4 (MedP) is somewhat intermediate with 18.8% permafrost and a watershed area of 11.4 km2 (Haugen et aI., 1982; Yoshikawa et aI., 1998). If we normalize the stream basin discharge by the watershed area (called specific discharge), it is possible to compare the stream hydrographs directly to elucidate the impact of permafrost on runoff (Figure 2). Basins with a higher proportion of ermafrost have reduced capability for infiltration, resulting in markedly higher peak flows during snowmelt and rainfall events. Conversely, watersheds underlain with large proportions of permafrost allow limited groundwater recharge, resulting in reduced stream baseflow between rain events. Water in streams emanating from basins with varying degrees of permafrost will also carry different chemical signatures as the water follows different pathways from source to stream (Petrone et al., 2000). Streams in watersheds with lower amounts of permafrost display higher conductivities as the groundwater feeding the stream has been in more contact with deeper mineral soils. Streams in basins with high permafrost generally display higher nitrate and dissolved carbon concentrations as most hillslope runoff is constrained to the near surface organic soils.', 'N/A', '68', 'Results and Discussions', 3, '1', 'Forest described', 'Horizons described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 199, 34, 199, 8, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The catchment''s hydrological response is driven by an interplay between surface and subsurface processes. One of its most characteristic features is its double peak runoff response, only occurring after a certain amount of catchment storage is exceeded (Martínez-Carreras et al., 2016). A first peak occurs almost simultaneously to rainfall and is mainly composed of event water, whereas the second peak is broader, lagged in time (several hours or days) and mainly composed of pre-event water (Martínez-Carreras et al., 2015; Wrede et al., 2015). Despite continuous refinement of the perceptual model of the WEC, a clear understanding of stream flow generation processes remains incomplete. Experimental studies suggest that lateral preferential flow through macropores along the hillslopes potentially contribute to the generation of the first peak of the hydrograph (Angermann et al., 2017; Martínez-Carreras et al., 2016). Modelling studies suggest that the first peak is solely generated by precipitation falling directly onto the stream and infiltration excess occurring in the riparian zone (Glaser et al., 2016, 2020; Rodriguez & Klaus, 2019). This finding is corroborated through high-resolution simulations of δ2H dynamics in the WEC, suggesting three distinct age components: catchment travel times from young water near the stream, weeks to a few years old water from hillslopes and weathered bedrock (saprock), and water with several years of mean travel times from weathered bedrock (saprock and saprolite) (Rodriguez & Klaus, 2019).

Therefore, a modified three-component hydrograph separation method was introduced. Field observations during rain events and the knowledge of the structure of the periglacial deposits (Stahr, 1979) lead to the following conceptual model of runoff generation. 1. During events, low silica runoff components are discharging, contributing from impervious and saturated\nareas. They are composed of event and pre!event water and react very sensitively. The total amount of these components is small. 2. At layers with lower hydraulic conductivity within the stratified periglacial debris cover as well as at the interface of the weathering zone and the crystalline hard rock, a perched water table spread during events, contributing medium silica runoff components. These components also react very sensitively. Lateral\nflow processes coupled with piston flow effects are assumed to be the dominant runoff generation processes. They occur in particular on the steep slopes, which represent a large area of the catchment. An acceleration of these processes by vertical macropore flows is likely. 3. Runoff components with high silica contribute from the deeper parts of the weathering zone and crystalline hard rock aquifer (lower debris cover). These components react less intensely during events and show a constant behaviour during recessions.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'A hydrograph separation for the November storm event (Figure 8a) indicates that new water comprises 5–20% of stream water, with the greatest percent contribution occurring a few hours prior to peak discharge. Overall ∼9% of storm discharge was new water (46 m3 of 512 m3 total discharge). Channel interception is estimated to be 31.4 m3 based on the precipitation amount and the stream channel area (∼1.5 meters wide by ∼800 m long; ∼1% of watershed area). This estimate is close to the total new water calculated using O isotopes and supports our assumption that most new water is derived from channel interception. Separation using Sr isotopes indicates that there is very little shallow subsurface flow until the sharp rise in stream discharge. At peak discharge shallow subsurface flow comprises ∼40% of total discharge, a value which is maintained on the falling limb. Significant shallow subsurface flow at this stage of the year is consistent with higher soil moisture due to reduced transpiration as trees enter winter dormancy. This increased soil moisture provides a water source to generate shallow subsurface flow.\nSeparation of the September 1998 storm event (Figure 8b) with oxygen isotopes indicates that between 10–30% of discharge is precipitation, with the greatest percent contribution occurring just prior to peak discharge. It is important to keep in mind that due to variation in the δ18O value of precipitation during this event, there is an overestimate of the precipitation component during the early part of the storm and an underestimate for the latter part of the storm. New water was ∼18% of total discharge (41.2 of 220.8 m3) which, again, is close to the estimated amount of channel interception (45.0 m3). Results of the hydrograph separation using Sr isotope ratios generates a result that includes negative shallow subsurface flow and groundwater flow greater than the actual stream discharge. This erroneous result is caused by both the overestimate of channel interception from the δ18O separation, and also the fact that changes in stream 87Sr/86Sr do not reflect any throughfall contributions which, based on changes in δ18O, are clearly significant. This is well illustrated on Figure 5 in which it is observed that the greatest shift in δ18O has no corresponding shift in 87Sr/86Sr. The problem here is most likely with the composition of our throughfall end-member. Because we did not collect end-member samples during this storm event it is difficult to accurately constrain the throughfall composition. Potential changes in end-member compositions (i.e., very low Sr concentration; 87Sr/86Sr ratio of throughfall similar to stream water) that may resolve this problem seem highly unlikely. Although the hydrograph separation produces unreasonable results, a qualitative assessment of the changes in the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of stream water is possible. Because the total change in the 87Sr/86Sr ratio is smaller, and because this change only occurs during a brief period after peak discharge (Figure 5), one can infer that soil water makes up a significantly smaller component of the September 1998 storm compared to the November 1997 storm. The lack of shallow subsurface flow is not surprising for a storm event that occurred when trees were still actively transpiring and thus lowering soil moisture [Likens and Bormann, 1995]. As a result, precipitation during the growing season will enter the soil profile with some flowing quickly through macropores into the till, resulting in increased groundwater flow of old water [McDonnell, 1990], while the remainder enters the soil matrix but never reaches the saturation level necessary to generate shallow subsurface flow.\nThe hydrograph of the March 1999 snowmelt event (Figure 8c), where we did not analyze δ18O of stream water, was separated into shallow subsurface and groundwater flow paths using only Sr isotopes. Results indicate that soil water is a significant percentage of the storm flow on the rising limb of the hydrograph and reaches 40% immediately before peak discharge. This is in contrast to the two rain events where soil water is only significant on the falling limb of the hydrograph. On the falling limb of the snowmelt hydrograph, the 87Sr/86Sr ratio of stream water increased to values higher than at the start of the storm event. Because of this our mixing model again produces erroneous results, with deep flow contributions greater than total stream discharge. As stated earlier, we believe this is caused by increased flow from the upper portion of the watershed as thawing progressed up the watershed.', '5.4', '10', 'Hydrograph Separation', 2, '8', 'Vegetation described', 'N', 'Glacier described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 202, 251, 202, 2, 10, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Geological investigations suggest that the catchment slopes are formed of approximately 5- to 10-m thick weathered and fractured granite bedrock with an uneven surface. The infiltrating water seeps through these structures and drains to the aquifer to form the long-term baseflow (Sanda et al., 2009). Similarly, the data provide evidence that a significant volume of infiltrating water leaves the catchment through the sedimentary geological formations underlying the stream bed in the bottom of the valley. It is also apparent that the hydrogeological catchment boundary does not follow the topographical boundary. The aquifer in the valley bottom is about 150- to 200-m wide and over 30-m deep. Therefore, it plays an important role in transforming rainfall into runoff. The analysis of soil moisture conditions and consequently the analysis of water movement in the soil profile during particular episodes give the evidence of the prevailing shallow subsurface flow at or near to saturation. The mean value of the steady-state  infiltration rate on the hillslopes (Cambisols) is more than one order of magnitude higher than the maximum rainfall intensity measured during the examined period and surface ponding and partial overland flow appear rarely. Comparison of the stream hydrographs with the outflow from the collecting trench shows that the shapes are very similar and that the sub-catchment area drained by the trench is representative for the hillslope runoff processes occurring in the catchment. An example is given in Figure 3. Cross-correlations of the soil saturation, based on records of soil suction and water content measured by frequency domain reflectometry (FDR), revealed significant non-uniqueness of such records as well as spatial and temporal variability. However, almost immediate response of the tensiometers and water reflectometers on rainfall signal in all the three soil horizons supports the hypothesis that Cambisols with preferential pathways and located on fractured bedrock have the capability to percolate water with rates higher than that could be explained by the classical Richards’ (1931) model of the soil matrix flow. The same effect was observed in the laboratory on large undisturbed soil samples during ponded infiltration experiments (C ́ıslerov ́a et al., 2002). Figure 4 shows three selected episodes from the 2006 vegetation season. The soil saturation, derived from the FDR data, is compared with the course of streamflow and subsurface stormflow. The relationship is ambiguous, as the rising and falling hydrograph limbs do not relate to the same saturation. The rising limb demonstrates that the soil saturation has to reach a certain threshold before the flow initiates. During the recession, the soil saturation decreases quicker than the flow. It needs to be emphasized, however, that the point soil saturation measurements are compared here with the complete subsurface flow process at the scales of the hillslope segment and catchment as a whole. Measured FDR data are not included in the analysis.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', '[49] This study demonstrated the large spatial differences possible within a catchment in terms of runoff production and solute mobilization. The most obvious feature of the Brays Flat catchment is the effect of groundwater proximity to the soil surface and its effect on runoff and solute concentration in the near-surface zone.\n[50]Runoff production in the scald area and upper catchment are strongly associated with the formation of event or seasonal saturation in the near-surface zone (Figures 3 and 5). This implies that saturated overland flow is the dominant streamflow generation mechanism across the catchment. In the UCA, event and seasonal saturation takes the form of a perched aquifer within the A horizon of the Sodosol soils that dominate the catchment. The Sodosolic B horizon is of very low permeability and hence is a controlling factor with respect to perched saturated zones and runoff. Similar soil controls on runoff generation processes have been noted in tropical environments [Elsenbeer, 2001].\n[51] When combined with the marked seasonality of evaporative demand, a distinct annual pattern of saturation and runoff is apparent. Saturation and subsequent runoff occur in winter/spring illustrating the influence of evaporative demand (Figures 2 and 5). Similar patterns are observable in soil moisture and runoff for other studies in the area [Hughes et al., 2006].\n[52] Production of HOF is evident on the scald (Figure 2) and in the UCA (Figure 3). However, no runoff is produced from either site until saturation at the soil surface is more widespread. It is possible that saturation is both important in generation of runoff but, also to allow runoff producing areas to connect to stream gauging sites. Saturation of streamline areas allows runoff to move by overland flow from runoff producing areas to the gauging site. Before this threshold level of saturation is achieved, any runoff produced may simply reinfiltrate as it moves downslope. This is a similar process to that proposed by Grayson et al. [1997]. The behavior of sites UC178 and 27, indicate that the sites closest to the gauges were the last ones to experience saturation, and then, coinciding with flow at the gauges. This observation is consistent with the process outlined above, and indicates that runoff may progressively recharge perched aquifers or the near-surface zone along the streamline in periods of rainfall excess before runoff at the catchment outlet or gauging site is achieved. These processes are common in semiarid areas as noted by Bracken and Croke [2007].\n[53] Runoff from the scalded area begins well before that from the UCA (Figure 2) and produces a greater depth of runoff (Table 4). This illustrates the effect of higher antecedent water content on the scald, which is in turn influenced by the proximity of the permanent groundwater surface, the dominant control on runoff in the scald area. This mirrors the usually large contribution of riparian zones to stream runoff in humid climates [Burns et al., 2001; McGlynn and McDonnell, 2003]. Formation of a seasonally/event saturated zone in the near surface occurred relatively quickly during winter after rain (Figure 5). Groundwater has no impact on the runoff generation process in all but the scalded area and there is effectively no subsurface “connection” between the UCA and the scalded zone at the timescale of a runoff event. This is due to the direction of groundwater flow and the thickness and low permeability of the unsaturated regolith. This interpretation is supported by chloride residence time estimation at BFCC. Crosbie [2006] used the chloride mass balance method to estimate chloride residence time in the unsaturated zone to be between 30 000 and 500 000 years. The expansion and contraction of saturated zones that produce runoff is similar to the partial area theory of runoff generation [Betson, 1964; Dunne and Black, 1970].\n[54] Solute concentration of runoff from the UCA is very low reflecting the low solute concentration in the perched aquifer contributing to stream flow. This is in contrast to the scalded area where water EC in the near-surface zone (0–0.4 m) was up to 28 000 μS/cm reflecting evaporative concentration of solutes from the permanently saturated zone (>1.2 m below soil surface) with an EC of 3000–6000 μS/cm.\n[55] Shallow wells reveal an area where groundwater comes in close contact with the soil surface (Figure 4). Subsurface and overland flow chemistry show an increasing groundwater influence with proximity to this zone (Figure 6), indicating that this area is the conduit for “groundwater” to the stream. This process also implies that the groundwater connection to the stream is reliant on mixing in the near-surface zone which is controlled by soil properties. Grab samples of overland flow in this area support this. The effect of low Ksat and hydraulic gradient means that groundwater can only be “supplied” to the stream at reasonably low rates, and that overland flow is required to both mix with groundwater and transport it to the stream. Similar processes are responsible for the mobilization of water in the near-surface zone showing no groundwater influence in its chemistry. However, subsurface stormflow was observed supplying water to the stream on 4 July just before the cessation of flow, albeit at a very low rate.', '5', '9', 'Discussion', 5, '2', 'N', 'Soil types described', 'Geological types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 204, 22, 204, 2, 10, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Stage 1: Baseflow or conditions just prior to the storm event\nValley-bottom riparian saturated areas are recharged by deep groundwater seepage (and therefore the high Si and Mg2+ concentrations in riparian waters, Table 1) while local groundwater discharged at seeps moved rapidly downslope as surficial runoff along the steep slope gradients. The hydraulic gradient for seep groundwaters is much greater than the seepage gradient in the riparian/wetland areas, especially for the headwater catchments. Although some seep groundwater likely recharges the valley-bottom riparian areas, a large fraction of the seep runoff is delivered to the stream along streamlets. This is the period when the potential for expression of seep runoff in streamflow is at its maximum. Riparian water contributions to streamflow are high at the large catchment scale (S1) which has a larger riparian reservoir.\nStage 2: Rising limb of the hydrograph\nThis stage comprises the sharp rise of the hydrograph with increasing contributions of throughfall. Throughfall is intercepted at surface-saturated areas and is delivered to the drainage network as saturation excess runoff. The relative fractions (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5) of seep groundwater drop rapidly as large amounts of throughfall are mobilized. Contributions of riparian groundwater also increase due to: (a) displacement of riparian water by incident throughfall and precipitation (e.g., Waddington et al., 1993); (b) mixing and transport with throughfall water in saturation overland flow; and (c) displacement of riparian groundwater by initial (and increasing) inputs of hillslope interflow.\nStage 3: Just after peak flow and recession limb\nRiparian groundwater contributions to streamflow reach their peak due to elevated hydraulic gradients associated with hillslope event water flux. This is displayed by the elevated groundwater elevations in the valley bottom locations. Throughfall contributions continue to occur from distal saturated areas which are now hydrologically connected to the drainage network under peak catchment wetness.

Exfiltration of bedrock groundwater increases with increasing catchment order, and catchments with a greater exfiltration of bedrock groundwater have greater riparian buffering potential. In addition, the recharge by deeper bedrock groundwater flow is larger in second-order channels or the riparian zone along them than in zero-order and first-order catchments during the baseflow period.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Conductivities determined from dye travel times and bulk conductivities determined from steady-state flows together revealed a distribution of hydraulic conductivities in relatively homogenous loamy sand topsoils that allowed some solute export through bypass flow far in advance of the bulk of the wetting front. Surface-applied dye tracers moved and arrived with the lead outflows, apparently along preferential flowpaths, and concentrations peaked shortly after trench flow initiated. This preferential network was not associated with visually apparent macropores. Conductivities of the toposils calculated from the dye tracer velocities ranged from 864 to 2240 mm/h and were 1.9 to 4.9 times greater than the bulk conductivity (460 mm/h) determined from mass balance at quasi steady-state. The bulk and the maximum conductivities were much greater than the median value of 100 mm/h for surface conductivities previously measured at this site using small-scale permeameters [Du et al., 2016], substantiating previous observations that small-scale conductivity measurements tend to be low-biased [Brooks et al., 2004]. Dye tracer arrivals, soil moisture time series, piezometric behavior, and trench outflows all suggested sequential and spatially variable thresholds for perching and for interflow initiation. Along the same contour, both the amount of precipitation necessary to initiate perching and the rate of drainage were highly variable. Observations were consistent with the fill and spill concept but suggested multiple successive fill and spill events that affected the progression of flows and piezometer levels through the event. The subsurface depressional storage on the argillic surface contributed to large and spatially variable interflow generation thresholds of 131 and 208 mm. Even on a small and apparently homogenous hillslope segment, interflow generation thresholds varied by 59% between the two collection drains, raising the question of how interception trench length and segmentation affect inference. Event water fractions of the trench outflows increased steadily with the irrigation depth, peaking at 50%. The tight relationship between the depth of irrigation and the event water fraction indicates that high storm-to-storm variability in event water fractions in the same watersheds observed in past studies may be substantially a function of storm size. The cumulative amount of preevent water in trench flow exiting the slope was greater than the estimate of preevent water in the A and E horizons. This suggests that there was exchange of preevent water in the BE and Bt horizons with event water moving to the trench. The lack of perching in most of the piezometers in the upper half of the plot suggests that some flow moved through higher conductivity layers in the BE transition and Bt horizons, below the level of the piezometers, and some flow moved as unsaturated flow through the sand. Downslope travel distances on this hillslope were limited by the percolation of water through the argillic Bt horizon. The cumulative water balance for this experiment, along with the piezometric behavior, agreed with predictions by the simple downslope travel distance model proposed by Jackson et al. [2014] and by the steady-state kinematic wave equation including percolation through the impeding layer. Cumulative trench outflows equaled 49% of input water, suggesting that about half of the plot area contributed interflow that reached the trench. The observed range of conductivities suggests a distribution of interflow travel distances, so some solutes may travel much farther than would be predicted from the average velocities.', 'N/A', '6203', 'Conclusions', 2, '2', 'N', 'Horizons described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 207, 253, 207, 2, 6, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', '4.2. Soil moisture thresholds for storm runoff generation in the two contrasting revegetated catchments [...] In this study, we found that a non-linear relationship between antecedent soil moisture and runoff coefficient also existed in the grassland catchment, while no significant relationships were found in the forestland catchment (Fig. 6a and b). In the grassland catchment, the breached threshold point of antecedent soil moisture was ~18%, above which the runoff coefficient substantially increased. The soil moisture content of ~18% did not suggest that the soil is saturated. We believe that the ~18% threshold value of antecedent soil moisture would probably indicate the transition from suction-controlled infiltration to gravity-controlled infiltration. Wang et al. (2013) measured the soil water retention curve of the Changwu loessial soil, which was sampled from a place close to our study site. They found a clear soil moisture threshold value of ~20% in the relationship between pressure head (soil matric suction) and soil moisture content. When the soil moisture content was lower than 20%, water infiltration was strongly influenced by soil matric suction; when the soil moisture content was higher than 20%, soil matric suction significantly decreased, and water infiltration was mostly influenced by gravity. Based on the filter paper method, Li et al. (2020) measured the unsaturated permeability curve of the loessial soils on the CLP in the laboratory and found a similar pattern. Therefore, when the antecedent soil moisture is higher than 18%, gravity would significantly control rainfall infiltration, which favors the generation of surface runoff or subsurface lateral flow in the landforms with a steep gradient. Besides antecedent soil moisture, the grassland catchment also showed a clear threshold value of the sum of ASI and event precipitation (~210 mm) above which storm runoff significantly increased (Fig. 6c). This is consistent with the findings obtained by Detty and McGuire, 2010a, Detty and McGuire, 2010b. At this study site, the groundwater table is about 60–85 m deep (Pan et al., 2014), and, thus, the groundwater table on the hillslope was not monitored. The results of soil moisture comparison among the four monitoring sites indicate that the antecedent soil moisture condition of the grassland gully favors storm runoff generation (Fig. 7). However, the downhill gully of the forestland catchment is covered by a high density of trees and understory grasses (Fig. 2), which greatly increase the canopy interception rate of rainfall, and constrain the generation of storm runoff. For example, Ma et al. (2019) demonstrated that plantations of Robinia pseudoacacia and Pinus tabuliformis (common tree species used for plantation in the forestland catchment) could intercept 17.6% and 23.9% of the rainwater, respectively. Moreover, as suggested by Schwärzel et al. (2020), the vertical niche separation between trees and understory grasses, where the understory grasses consume water from the topsoil, and overstory mainly takes water from the subsoil, would likely result in limited deep percolation and, thus, affects runoff generation.\n4.3. Hydrological connectivity between the upper hillslope and downhill gully in the catchment. [...] As different from the mechanisms of storm runoff generation in the catchment of Penna et al. (2011), the catchments we studied are difficult to create hydrological connectivity between the upper hillslope and downhill gully through subsurface stormflow due to the dry climate, deep vadose zone and characteristics of topography. For example, the topographical connectivity between the upper hillslope and downhill gully is cut off by vertical loess cliff in the studied catchments. Such characteristics of topography make it more difficult to generate hydrological connectivity between the upper hillslope and downhill gully through subsurface flow. However, we believe that the hydrological connectivity between the two topographical units can be established through surface runoff (infiltration-excess overland flow). For example, during the rainfall event with the highest intensity that occurred on June 19, 2017, rainwater would quickly accumulate at the soil surface and generate storm runoff due to the short vegetation and minimal rainfall interception in the grassland catchment. The hydrological connectivity between the upper hillslope and downhill gully would also be quickly established through infiltration-excess overland flow during this rainfall event (Table 4). Therefore, the streamflow of the grassland catchment quickly peaked after the storm onset, while the soil moisture in the hillslopes could not reach the peak at a short time, which resulted in the moment of maximum stream discharge preceding the peak of the hillslope soil moisture (Table 2S). However, the forestland catchment generated very low streamflow during this rainfall event (0.06 mm), which only occupied 0.7% of the event stormflow of the grassland catchment (8.05 mm). We believe that surface runoff (infiltration-excess overland flow) may also quickly generate on the upper hillslope of the forestland catchment, where vegetation coverage is relatively low, and then flow into the downhill gully. However, the dense vegetation cover and high capacity of soil infiltration in the downhill gully of the forestland catchment significantly delayed and reduced the storm runoff during this event (Figs. 2, 4S). For the event on July 10, 2018, the hillslope soil moisture (0–10 cm) in the grassland catchment peaked prior to the streamflow peak, and the catchment generated the highest runoff coefficient during the study period, indicating the establishment of a higher level of hydrological connectivity between the upper hillslope and downhill gully (Table 4). In the forestland catchment, the low peak rainfall intensity and the low intensity of surface stormflow did not favor the building of the hydrological connectivity that links the upper hillslope to downhill gully to establish and resulted in a low value of the runoff coefficient during the same event. In this event, the storm runoff was mainly infiltration-excess overland flow because the soil moisture in upper hillslope and downhill gully did not reach saturation in both catchments.', '4.2, 4.3', '12', 'Soil moisture thresholds for storm runoff generation in the two contrasting revegetated catchments, Hydrological connectivity between the upper hillslope and downhill gully in the catchment', 4, '5', 'Multiple land-covers described', 'Soil types described', 'Geological types described', 'Topography described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 208, 155, 208, 8, 6, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Runoff responses to rainfall were found to be more rapid and with greater quickflow volumes for the Ultisol watershed than for the Oxisol watershed. For the Ultisol, the lower Ks at 50 cm depth compared to the upper soil horizons leads to a stronger lateral flow component, while increasing Ks with depth for the Oxisol allows for increased subsurface percolation. Overland flow was found to be a frequent occurrence for both watersheds, although the response rate of overland flow detectors was higher on the Ultisol. Measured throughfall intensities were often higher than Ks at the soil surface, indicating that Hortonian runoff could be important overland flow mechanism for the study watersheds. Quickflow was found to represent a relatively minor fraction of total stream flow for both the Oxisol and the Ultisol catchments studied, though there was 30% more quickflow for the Ultisol catchment. Quickflow is an important mechanism by which relatively unprocessed DOC is transported from the terrestrial to the aquatic environment, since the surface and near surface flowpaths that com-prise quickflow are highly enriched in DOC compared to the slower and deeper flowpaths that contribute to base flow.

The thickness of unconsolidated material (overburden) above the bedrock surface ranges from 0 m to more than 130 m. Aquifer recharge in the study area results from the infiltration of precipitation on upland glacial sand and silty sand deposits, and from direct runoff from the uplands that infiltrates sandy deposits along some of the tributaries (Kappel and Young, 1989).

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', '[38] On the basis of intensive hydrological and hydrochemical observations, the existence of hydrological pathways through the bedrock was demonstrated in a weathered granite headwater catchment. Vertical distributions in the riparian groundwater SiO2 concentration are produced by differences in soil and bedrock permeability, and concentrations in the saturated through flow generated at the soil-bedrock interface and the bedrock flow originating in deep seepage at the hillslope. The former component recharges the shallow layer of the groundwater body and the latter component recharges the deep layer of the groundwater. The signature in the chemical tracer of each flow is conserved, with little mixing within the body of groundwater.\n[39] Recent research has indicated that the chemical signatures of hillslope runoff may differ from those in streamflow in many catchments, such as the PMRW [Burns et al., 2001] or Sleepers River [McGlynn et al., 1999]. Our results showed the hillslope-riparian linkage in a small headwater catchment. Two flows dominate the linkage of water flow through the hillslope, hillslope/riparian interface to the riparian zone: the saturated through flow occurring at the soil-bedrock interface during rainstorms and the bedrock flow, which probably occurs year round except during the driest season. The bedrock flow rate is not negligible, and may even exceed the saturated through flow [Katsuyama et al., 2004]. Most of the water contributing to the stream discharge infiltrates the largest part of the catchment, the hillslope area, and then recharges the deeper groundwater body. Therefore bedrock permeability is an important factor to be considered in the study of hillslope-riparian linkages.', 'N/A', '10', 'Conclusion ', 4, '2', 'N', 'Soil types described', 'Geological types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 211, 114, 211, 9, 1, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'In situ infiltration tests using simulated rainfall were conducted in order to measure the infiltration rates near each runoff plot (Table 1). In nearly all rainfall events during the observed period, the maximum rainfall intensities were below the mean value of infiltration rate (Fig. 3). Hortonian overland flow may be hard to generate at each runoff plot, although it may be possible to generate overland flow at plots S3 and S4 because of their relatively low infiltration rate compared with the other plots. However, during many rainfall events, surface runoff was generated from each plot. Although the infiltration rates were higher than the rainfall intensities, surface runoff was generated and may have contributed to “biomat” flow. Sidle et al. (2007) first introduced the concept of biomat flow. They installed runoff plots (2 m by 0.5 m) on forested hillslopes in the Mie catchment, Japan, and calculated both overland flow and biomat flow. They estimated that overland flow accounted for 14.6% and 3.5% of total rainfall in hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtusa) and deciduous plots, respectively, and estimated biomat flow as 46.3% and 28.5% of the total rainfall in the hinoki and deciduous plots, respectively. Sidle et al. (2007) showed that the amount of biomat flow was more than that of overland flow, implying that surface runoff may be affected largely by biomat flow rather than by Hortonian overland flow. When the litter layer and/or mineral soil become fully saturated by continuous rainfall, surface runoff can be generated on the forest floor; this surface runoff is different from Hortonian overland flow. In this study, the storm runoff under the wet condition (API7 > 20 mm) showed a good linear relationship with total storm precipitation (Fig. 6), and this relationship was reflected in the percolation rate of subsoil at each plot. Moreover, when storm precipitation was >50 mm, the differences in storm runoff between dry and wet conditions decreased gradually (Fig. 6), which might imply that storm precipitation over 50 mm had the potential to saturate fully the litter layer and mineral soil and contribute to saturated overland flow. In this study, however, during many rainfall events, surface runoff was initiated before the litter layer became fully saturated (see Section 3.3). Some studies (e.g., McDonnell et al., 1991, Sidle et al., 1995, Kim et al., 2005) have reported shallow flow paths through the organic horizon over unsaturated mineral soil layer, and this flow has been described a pseudo-Hortonian overland flow. In addition, Gomi et al. (2008) indicated that overland flow can be generated over the litter layer overlying mineral soil because of soil hydrophobicity. Therefore, the surface runoff generation in this study that occurred before full saturation of the litter layer and mineral soil would have been contributed to by mainly pseudo-Hortonian overland flow, including Hortonian overland flow and biomat flow.', '4.1', '82', 'Pseudo-Hortonian overland flow generation', 1, '1', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 212, 260, 212, 1, 6, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The three watersheds showed very low annual runoff ratios during the 3-year record, combined with long spells of zero flow. [...] Like Amatya et al. (1996) and Slattery et al. (2006), we found that soil properties, especially buried argillic horizons with low permeability (i.e., the throttle for lateral flow), strongly influenced runoff generation in these low-relief coastal plain regions [...] Our site, like that reported by Devito et al. (2005a), showed that dry catchment conditions frequently led to dis-connectivity of the uplands with the valley bottom and stream. This resulted in low runoff coefficients and the dominance of evaporation in the water balance. In addition, direct precipitation on the stream channel can alter the isotope signal, when flow is close to zero. This was observed during March 2011, when very heavy precipitation (δ18O = 3.9 ‰) led to a deviation between stream isotope signals and riparian isotopic signals adjacent to the streams throughout the area. Figure 8 conceptually summarizes the runoff generation and isotopic signature at the study site. A key element is the rare or nonexistent connectivity in the hillslope–riparian–stream continuum and the enrichment in heavy water isotopes in the riparian zone/wetlands that supplies baseflow. Further, the deeper groundwater system can interact with the groundwater of the riparian zone during wet conditions and is likely a major contributor to the riparian groundwater. [...] The strong evaporative enrichment of groundwater suggests groundwater recharge influenced by enriched soil water.  Streams and riparian groundwater were even more enriched in heavy isotopes, suggesting further isotopic enrichment of the riparian groundwater as it reemerged in the low-relief and slow-moving stream floodplain. Our measured isotopic enrichment and the low annual runoff coefficients suggest that evapotranspiration strongly influences the runoff dynamics in the R, B, and C watersheds, consistent with the behavior of other lower-relief watersheds in the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the USA (La Torre Torres et al., 2011) and elsewhere (Devito et al., 2005a).', '4', '131', 'Discussion', 6, '1', 'N', 'Horizons described', 'Geological types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 213, 1, 213, 2, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Differences in the proportions of water sources in the stream stem from mixing of water from multiple runoff pathways, which may be related to variability in the depth of the organic-mineral boundary (Tables 2 and 3), fire history, and active layer depth (Figures 3 and 5).\n5.2.1 Spring Snowmelt Runoff Over Frozen Soils\nSpring runoff was dominated by the precipitation and organic components (Figure 8) with a depleted isotopic signature similar to the winter flow end-member (Table 4 and Figure 6). Given that active layers are shallow in May (Figure 3a), soil storage potential is limited and water reaches the stream quickly [Roulet and Woo, 1986]. The precipitation signature indicates that runoff was unable to leach material from catchment soils. This runoff could have originated from the burned slope where organics are minimal and mineral soils are still frozen, and/or it could indicate water moving through organic soil pipes. Such pipes transport water rapidly, limit water-soil interactions relative to overland flow or throughflow, and are an important runoff mechanism in organic boreal soils in the early summer [Carey and Woo, 2000]. Spring runoff also contains organic-rich water, indicating that this runoff is leaching material from the shallow organic soils that have already thawed. In the spring, the large aufeis features in the riparian area are thawing, suggesting that much of the early-summer organic flow may be related to aufeis melt leaching organic material from the woody shrubs that dominate the riparian zone. [...]\n5.2.2 Summer Base flow From a Small Aquifer in Coarse, Upper Catchment Soils\nMineral base flow was small to absent in early May, but increased toward mid-summer and dominated during inter-storm periods (Figure 8). The upper catchment contains sparser vegetation, a thinner loess cap [Kelsey et al., 2012], and coarser mineral soils, which are often associated with greater active layer depths, overall less permafrost extent and quicker soil drainage [Jorgenson et al., 2013]. Such conditions may contribute to the development of a thicker subsurface aquifer capable of storing water on longer time scales and producing a mineral-rich base flow component to the stream hydrograph (Figure 10a). The appearance of the mineral base flow signature in late-May to early-June may indicate that the active layer has deepened into the mineral soils at this time, allowing storage and drainage of deeper soil areas; on 2 June 2010, the mean thaw depth was 24 cm (Figure 3a), which is just deeper than the mean organic-mineral boundary determined from soil coring (mean = 23 cm, Table 3).\nThe mineral base flow hydrology and chemistry is inconsistent with an older, regional water flow source. The base flow discharge is buffered from individual storm events, but it does respond to variations in seasonal and interannual water availability (Figure 8), suggesting that the aquifer drainage/flow paths are relatively short and likely not regionally controlled. Furthermore, the mineral base flow chemistry is indistinguishable from mineral runoff, which again implies similar flow path lengths between base flow and runoff and is inconsistent with altered isotopic values and elevated mineral concentrations that might be expected with longer, deeper flow paths and regional flow. [...]\n5.2.3 Combined Fill and Spill and Preferential Flow Control Storm Runoff\nRunoff events were generally characterized by sharp peaks that elevated both organic and mineral-rich stream chemistry (Figure 8). The flashiness of storm events indicates that runoff reaches the stream rapidly, which is inconsistent with substantial interaction between runoff and the riparian area. Runoff from the hillslopes may bypass the riparian soils by moving as overland flow on top of the impermeable riparian duff or through the ephemeral anabranches. The organic signal in runoff events was expected given that organic soils promote quick flow (Figure 3b and Table 2) and make up a large proportion of the catchment. During mid to late summer, mineral runoff reaches the stream on the same time scale as organic runoff (Figure 8) despite its lower permeability (Figure 3b). Differences in the duration of mineral and organic runoff suggest that they are decoupled, which could be explained by organic runoff originating on unburned slopes, and mineral runoff originating on burned slopes.\nThe rapidity with which mineral runoff reaches the stream may be related to changes in the dominant runoff mechanism after a fire. In the organic soil infiltration tests, water infiltrated vertically and only moved laterally once it reached the organic-mineral boundary (Table 2), consistent with the fill and spill concept, which has been shown to control runoff in peat-covered permafrost terrain [Carey and Woo, 2002; Wright et al., 2009]. How much organic throughflow reaches the stream may be limited by the subsurface topography (Figure 5), and multiple subsurface basins that must be filled before the water may continue downslope (Figure 10b). \n[...]\n5.2.4 Slower Supra-Permafrost Drainage\nSoil drainage over monthly time scales may occur due to deep drainage network beneath the unburned soils (dashed arrows in Figure 10c) rather than to the fill and spill that controls shallow organic soil runoff (solid arrows in Figure 10c). Throughflow experiments indicated that a substantial fraction of infiltrating water may move into the deeper mineral soils, especially in unburned soils (Table 3). This water may be stored in mineral soils and released back to the atmosphere as a result of the substantial evapotranspiration potential in interior boreal catchments [Bolton et al., 2004], or it may eventually reach the stream after traveling through deeper, less permeable flow paths. There were no significant isotopic variations in summer stream water even during storms (Figure 6), implying limited interaction between runoff and water stored in the catchment over longer time scales. The importance of drainage through longer flow paths is supported by the presence of isotopically depleted, high EC, high DOC aufeis that builds up in the riparian area over the winter months. Similar to previous findings, these aufeis features played a limited role in the stream water budget [Reedyk et al., 1995], but are an important indicator of slower drainage and could be more important for mobilizing organic matter from the riparian area as they thaw.\nDeep subsurface gullies found at approximately 150 m spacing on the unburned slopes (Figure 5a) and beneath a consistently wet area (Figure 5b) hint at areas of preferential drainage at the frozen-unfrozen boundary. These deeper active layer gullies could form through thermal erosion as water and heat move along the frozen-unfrozen boundary. Heat advection has been recognized as an important mechanism for thawing frozen ground in other boreal catchments underlain by permafrost, leading to the development of taliks [McKenzie et al., 2007; Rowland et al., 2011], near-stream thaw bulbs [Brosten et al., 2006], and subsurface preferential flow paths [Cozzetto et al., 2013]. Given that deeper soils tend to be less permeable (Figure 3b), this water would reach the stream well after its infiltration into the hillslope, which is consistent with the observed aufeis, formed by water that reaches the stream months after recharge by spring snowmelt and summer rains. Longer catchment residence times are also consistent with the aufeis chemistry (Table 4): depleted δ18O suggests that this water was subject to fractionation potentially related to evapotranspiration, and high EC and DOC indicates that this water has had substantial (ie. longer duration) contact with both organic and mineral soils as it moves to the stream.', '5.2', '8154', 'Catchment Runoff Mechanisms', 4, '9', 'Shrubland described', 'Soil types described', 'Geological types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 214, 258, 214, 9, 10, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The ERT results supported by well data indicate that the hydrogeology of the valley floodplain is highly complex as a result of the Pleistocene glacial processes of erosion and deposition. A shallow groundwater body can be identified in the initial 1–1.5 m of the soil profile but is very small and occurs over an unsaturated sublayer (higher resistivity values; more impervious). The characteristics of water level fluctuations within a well transect near the main stream channel suggest that this superficial groundwater is unconfined (Wenninger et al., 2004). Because of the technical difficulties of augering deep enough, nothing can be said about the general pressure status of the deeper aquifer below that could be temporally variable, i.e. possibly confined conditions during winter or after snowmelt and during flood generation. The complex hydrogeology in the valley bottom area surrounded by steep slopes also presents complex circumstances for the runoff generation process. This in turn suggests a diverse range of runoff sources and potential for mixing of different runoff components. First, the deep groundwater source is able to contribute towards streamflow due to its exfiltration on the saturated areas of the floodplain and the resulting surface flow (channelized in drainage trenches) across the valley floor towards the main stream (Figure 13). This was observed during the whole year, with temporary artesian groundwater discharge.\nSecond, the same deep groundwater source can mix with both saturation overland flow (the classical Dunne mechanism) and exfiltrating, shallow groundwater from the discontinuous,  surficial aquifer. Third, and of particular interest, is the extension of the deeper groundwater aquifer from the steep slopes (hard rock aquifer) across, and beneath, the valley floor which seems to be de-coupled in most areas from the surface hydrology, except from the initiation of saturated areas. This is due to the existence of an overlying, near-continuous unsaturated (significantly less permeable) layer, as indicated by the ERT measurements. [...] If, in this case, lower electrical resistivity reflects material with higher hydraulic conductivity the latter could provide preferential pathways of groundwater movement (‘veins’), analogous to concentrated surface flow in channel networks. \n ', 'N/A', '1509', 'DISCUSSION', 2, '1', 'N', 'N', 'Geological types described', 'Slopes described', 'N', 'Unknown items identified', 'N', 215, 24, 215, 2, 2, 2),

[...]  On the basis of this observational result, Ohta (1990) proposed that the ‘variable source volume concept’ is more appropriate than the ‘variable source area concept’ to describe runoff generation on steep forested catchments. During this study, we found further evidence which indicates that, in addition to discharge, both source area, A,?, (surface saturated area) and subsurface saturated area, A,,, also depend strongly on the saturated groundwater volume. Kubota (in prep.) also carried out hydrograph separation work by using the stable isotope, oxygen-18. The isotope concentrations of rainfall, soil water, river water and the water draining from soil pipes were measured during storm events. These concentration measurements were then used for solving the water balance equations for each event, thus separating ‘new event water’ from ‘pre-event water’. Figure 5 shows the result of hydrograph separation for the storm event of September 1992, and suggests that most of the subsurface runoff comes from ‘displaced water’ or ‘pre-event water’. [...] The observation results of Ohta (1990) and Kubota (in prep.) indicate strongly the dominant control of subsurface runoff by the saturated volume of groundwater.

We argue that the Variable Sources Area Concept proposed by Hewlett (1982) is valid for the LCP region which perhaps represents the extreme landscape where the saturated area can expand during wet periods and contract during dry periods over a large magnitude.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'As a whole, during such a major type of event following relatively dry hydrological conditions, chemical and isotopic hydrograph separations indicate that the water from the deep layers of the hillslope as well as the pre-event contributions to the total streamflow are dominant (as shown in other similar catchments, Hooper and Shoemaker, 1986, Robson and Neal, 1990 as examples) (Table 3). The chemical tracers (DOC and silica) allowed us to quantify the contributions both in the hydrological subcatchment RAZS (i.e. including Zones I and II) and at the outlet (i.e. including Zones I–III). The direct contribution of rainwater is negligible whereas the upper layers of the saturated areas play a significant role particularly at the maximum of the first event.\nDuring the recession stage preceding the event (Table 3), water is mainly composed of “old-water” draining the deep layers of the superficial formations in Zones I and II (i.e. the upper subcatchment).\nDuring the first flood event (Table 3), at the maximum, saturated areas mainly located in the hydrological Zone III response to the rain probably by overland runoff then by groundwater ridging as indicated by piezometer water level and isotopic data. Rainwater penetrates in the coarse texture soils of the catchment unsaturated slopes and contribute to reconstitute the water storage of the catchment. These waters are then mixed with pre-existing waters. The contribution of the upper hillslope in Zone I is very weak because soils are dry and reconstitute their storages. Most of the runoff comes from the down stream part of the basin. On the opposite, rainwater (i.e. event water) falling on the saturated areas, mainly reacts on the upper layers of the saturated areas of zone III, mix rapidly with pre-existing waters and participate instantaneously to the total streamflow. Even if these saturated areas are representing only 2% of the whole catchment area — and occupying mainly the hydrological zone III, — about 30% of the waters at the outlet originate from their surface layers as indicated by chemical tracers. The increase of Zone III contribution and of event water proportion reinforce this hypothesis. However, as a whole the pre-event water from the deep layers of the hillslope remains highly dominant.\nAt the maximum discharge of the second event, the increasing contribution of Zone II and stream flow in Zone I as well as piezometer levels in the saturated area let us think that lateral piston could have produced water level ridging in the saturated areas (mainly in zone III). The proportion of event waters becomes relatively more important whereas waters from deep layers of the hillslope are proportionally higher than during the first event as indicated by chemical tracers. The waters from the deep layers of the hillslopes in the upper subcatchments now reach the stream. This contributes to water supply in the saturated areas which are connected to the stream. Hence the contribution of the upper layers of these areas to stream flow becomes lower.\nIn the final stage, Zones II and III contribute in the same proportion to streamflow, event water proportion goes reducing whereas the deep layers of the hillslopes become highly dominant. This indicates that rainwater which fall in the upper part of this catchment does not participate directly to the stream flow generation during such an event. However, this water contributes to reconstitute the catchment water storage particularly in the deep layers of the hillslope superficial formations. In the final stage, this water is released mainly in Zones II and III by lateral deep flow. The final state is characterised by a balanced contribution between aquifers located in moraine (Zone II) and downslope (Zone III).', '5', '271', 'Discussion and conclusions', 7, '3', 'N', 'Soil texture described', 'Glacier described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 218, 221, 218, 9, 6, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'According to the available, detailed dual-permeability simulations of lateral chloride transport in the midslope area (Laine-Kaulio et al., 2014a), preferential flowpaths can deliver 140 times more chloride downslope than the soil matrix under highly saturated soil moisture conditions. Compared to the C horizon with a minor preferential flow fraction, the lateral transport capacity of the preferential flow domain was 5-fold in the BC horizon, 50-fold in the B horizon and 76-fold in the E horizon (cf. Fig. 9c). According to Laine-Kaulio et al. (2014b), runoff generation in the midslope area is characterized by the transmissivity feedback phenomenon and dominated by lateral by-pass flow; correlations found between the dye coverage and different characteristics of lateral preferential flow (Fig. 9) support this conception.\nWithin the shallow soil profiles of the slope shoulder and slope foot study plots, the porosities of preferential flowpaths did not show a reduction with depth, implying that the hydraulic conductivity also does not reduce within the shallow soil depth, and that the transmissivity feedback phenomenon does not apply. Findings of Backnäs et al. (2015) support this conception as they found considerable amount of dye throughout the soil profile at the slope shoulder and slope foot study plots in their experiments. Backnäs et al. (2015) reported also that the E horizon was not fully colored, but instead, the entire soil profiles had distinctly colored and colorless spots. Combining the findings of Backnäs et al. (2015) to our porosity estimates of preferential flowpaths we inferred that the flowpath network in the entire shallow and loose soil profile, as well as flowpaths on the underlying bedrock surface, are crucial for runoff generation at the slope shoulder.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'From the 31.1 mm of water lost inside the plot during the first day, about 6.1 mm (20%) reappeared in the surface flow collected on the second day. For almost 20 h this water had remained in hydrological reservoirs close to the surface (e.g. soil pockets or shallow rocks). An increasing chloride concentration at the very end of the second day (Figure 10) indicates that not all of this first day’s water had appeared by the end of the second day’s sprinkling. It may be concluded that, in the present experimental plot, a considerable percentage of the infiltrating water is stored in shallow reservoirs, such as soil pockets, and does not infiltrate into deep underground karst water systems. Most of these soil pockets have to be filled to allow runoff generation on the entire plot. As already observed in sprinkling experiments on an arid hillslope (Yair, 1983) the saturation of soil is accelerated by contributions of runoff generated on neighbouring rocky areas. During the 2 days of the experiment different stages of runoff generation were noticed, and these can be described in a schematic model (Figure 12). (a) During the first interrupted rain spell of the first day, only rocky parts in the immediate vicinity of the outlet produced flow, exhibiting a typical condition of partial area runoff contribution. The flow rate was constantly low, as all flow from other rock outcrops infiltrated into soil pockets (stage 1). (b) During the second rain spell of the first day (16 mm of rain had been applied), small soil pockets close to the outlet became saturated and generated flow as well. The flow rate started to increase (stage 2). (c) Towards the end of the first day (after 37 mm of applied rain) a large percentage of the soil was saturated; only some deep soil pockets in the central part still retained runoff. The flow rate increased step by step but did not reach a constant value (stage 3). (d) Only on the second day (almost 53 mm of rainfall were applied since sprinkling had started the day before) was almost the entire slope saturated. The first and second day’s waters mixed and the flow rate rose to a constant value (stage 4). Net infiltration at its final rate was very low (2.6–3 mm h 1 ) and is attributed to losses into the dolostone bedrock (below). A simple calculation may further illustrate the relevance of the lateral redistribution of surface runoff. Comparing the final infiltration rates of both days and the limited soil storage in the plot, a soil moisture state close to maximum saturation already at the end of the first day may be assumed. To reach this state, 31 mm of rainfall was required. If on rock outcrops 2 mm were needed to fill surface depressions (the amount that was required to generate flow from rocky parts close to the plot outlet), 29 mm was transferred from the rock outcrops to neighbouring soil-covered parts. On the soil-covered parts (38% of the plot was composed of bare rock, 62% was covered by soil) this amount corresponded to 18 mm of additional water. Hence, without laterally transferred runoff from rocky areas, 47 mm of rainfall would have been required to reach the day 1 moisture status. Deep infiltration into the underlying carbonate rock was little significant on the present experimental plot, as indicated by two major facts: (a) a large percentage of first day’s water remained for 20 h in shallow reservoirs within the soil and could be reactivated as runoff during the second day; (b) a constant flow rate condition was reached on the second day, when almost 90% of the rainfall was converted to surface runoff.', 'N/A', '290', 'Discussion', 2, '2', 'N', 'N', 'Geological types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 220, 52, 220, 2, 6, 2),

Likewise, water table variations (rise or fall) were on some occasions not in phase with runoff changes, suggesting somewhat more intricate hydrological behaviour. Soil water potential data in relation with runoff and water table data revealed that the development of a perched saturation layer was a relatively frequent process. Investigation of soil water potential and water table dynamics during a collection of representative “simple floods” resulted in the identification of three types of characteristic hydrological behaviour during the year, relating mainly to the seasonality of catchment water reserves, but also to rainfall characteristics (intensity, duration). The type 1 event identified during dry conditions, the type 2 event (wetting-up transition) and the type 3 event (wet conditions) each had different characteristics and were associated with different dominant storm-runoff generation processes. In dry conditions, storm-runoff was generated essentially as infiltration excess runoff on low permeable areas, whereas saturation excess runoff dominated during wetting-up and wet conditions. However, corresponding saturated areas prone to saturation excess runoff resulted from different processes. During wetting-up transition, they resulted from the development of scattered perched water tables in the terraced area, whereas under wet conditions they were linked to the rise of the deep water table.', 'N/A', '217', 'Summary and conclusions', 1, '3', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'Topography described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 221, 33, 221, 1, 5, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'In dry conditions (usually, summer period), only fast and limited storm-runoff responses are observed at the catchment outlet (Figure 7A). Because of low stream discharges, low water table and relatively dry soils prior to storm, no topsoil saturation or water table rise is likely to occur during a rainfall event. Therefore, no water-saturated area for runoff production can develop within the catchment and the only possible runoff-contributing areas in dry conditions correspond to local low-permeable areas (bedrock outcrops or degraded areas) close to the stream. In consequence, for short (and often intense) rainfall events occurring in dry conditions, infiltration excess runoff is most often the dominant runoff process in Mediterranean mountain catchments, as suggested by several authors (Topadilis and Curtis 1982 [Australia]; Cosandey 1993 [France]; Ceballos and Schnabel 1998 [Spain]; Lana-Renault et al. 2007 [Spain]; Latron et al. 2008; Latron and Gallart 2008 [Vallcebre catchments, Spain]).\nDuring wetting-up periods, common in Mediterranean climates (Gaillard et al. 1995 [France]; Grésillon et al. 1997 [France]; Piñol et al. 1997 [Spain]), more frequent or larger rainfall events generate larger runoff events with moderate storm-runoff coefficients and variable peakflows (Figure 7B). Throughout these phases of steady restoration of catchment water reserves, larger rainfall volumes help the formation of water-saturated areas from place to place within the catchment, through the frequent development of perched saturation layers, and also at downslope locations. The steady saturation of the catchment favors an increasing contribution of saturation excess runoff, which leads to a steadily larger hydrological response. During wetting-up periods, delayed water table response occurs sometimes (Gaillard et al. 1995 [France]; Latron and Gallart 2008 [Vallcebre catchments, Spain]), as well as longer response times (time interval between rainfall and runoff peaks), relating to the delay necessary for the formation of a perched saturation layer before significant saturation excess runoff takes place.\nIn wet conditions, when soils are saturated or close to saturation, large and long-lasting runoff responses generally occur in reaction to low intensity, but generally long rainfall episodes (Figure 7C). Under these circumstances, the quick rise of the shallow water table often promotes extensive surface saturation within the catchment, favorable to saturation excess runoff generation. Evidence of the quick response of the water table and of the relevance of saturated areas to the hydrological response of Mediterranean mountain catchments during wet conditions has often been found (Cosandey 1993 [France]; Grésillon and Taha 1998 [France]; Latron and Gallart 2007 [Vallcebre catchments, Spain]). This explains that, in wet conditions, the hydrological behavior of Mediterranean mountain catchment is ultimately very similar to that generally reported in more humid climates. Although saturation excess runoff in saturated areas is often described as a relevant runoff generation process in Mediterranean mountain catchments during wet conditions, the contribution of sub-surface runoff processes must be seen as a complementary process of runoff formation (e.g. Marc et al. 2001 [France]; Cras et al. 2007 [France]). However, as noted by Beven (2002), sub-surface processes have been investigated lesser and no accurate understanding of their hydrological role in Mediterranean mountain catchments is currently available.', '6', '2055', 'Runoff Processes', 3, '4', 'Vegetation described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 222, 33, 222, 2, 1, 2),

The tile drains do not necessarily contribute in such summer events, but this is highly dependent on the antecedent soil moisture conditions and crack development. The “transition” months April and May are still influenced by winter soil moisture conditions. In October runoff generation is dependent on the gradual soil moisture rise through declining evapotranspiration rates and so features the highest variability in runoff coefficients (Fig. 4(a)). The winter months are characterized through constantly high soil moisture states, continuous tile drain discharge and a quick response of the saturated fields to surface runoff. Concluding the behaviour of the Tannhausen catchment, individual events show a classifiable behaviour but they are strongly dependent on soil moisture and antecedent climatic conditions so that predictions seem to be difficult without knowledge about actual soil moisture conditions. A spatial observation of soil moisture could be helpful for prediction of antecedent conditions (Zehe et al., 2005). On the other hand, seasonal prediction seems to be rather easy in clay soil catchments. The process study in the Tannhausen microscale catchment shows the strong domination of soil moisture for runoff generation. In winter the soil reacts like a sealed surface, contributing to most of the runoff volume. The precipitation pattern of an event dominates runoff generation. In summer the soil with its cracks reacts like a sponge, reducing surface runoff generation to sealed surfaces.', 'N/A', '314', 'SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION', 1, '5', 'Pasture described', 'Soil texture described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 223, 225, 223, 1, 1, 2),

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Streamflow pathways were very different between headwater and higher-order streams. The headwater catchment was dominated by subsurface flow, consistent with our previous study at two headwater catchments in Valles Caldera, i.e. Redondo Creek and La Jara Creek catchments (15 and 4 km 2 , respectively, Liu et al., 2005). With an increase in drainage area downstream, the streamflow pathways become more  heterogeneous, with significant contributions of groundwater and near-surface runoff directly generated from snowmelt and monsoonal rainfall. This change is caused by the differences in distribution of soils along elevations. Higher elevations have deep and well-drained soil subunits of Mirand Alanos complexes, Redondo-Rubble land associations, Redondo coarse sandy loams, Redondo cobbly coarse sandy loams\nand Calaveras loams (Muldavin and Tonne, 2003). Information at a 1-m soil pit excavated at 3018 m indicates that three horizons were identified: O (0–15 cm), A (10–55 cm) and C (55–100 cm), with sandy clay loam, sandy loam and loamy sand, respectively (unpublished data, Fred Phillips and John Wilson, 2004). Two types of roots were observed: grass roots within the upper 10 cm and woody roots of the ponderosa pines at the 20–40 cm depth. The well-drained soils at higher elevations facilitate infiltration of snowmelt and rainwater and prevent the occurrence of near-surface runoff. When the infiltration encounters bedrock or materials with lower hydraulic conductivity, subsurface flow occurs laterally (e.g. Newman et al., 1997, 1998; Wilcox et al., 1997). A field observation shows that lateral subsurface flow generates from shallow soils at higher elevations (Figure 9(a)). Areas along valley bottoms and streams are typically clay-rich, poorly drained vertisols or mollisols developed in alluvial and fan deposits (Muldavin and Tonne, 2003). These soils are fine-textured, ranging from clay to loam, ith well-developed organic horizons and few rock fragments. Due to low hydraulic conductivity, these soils facilitate the occurrence of infiltration-excess and saturation overland flow (together termed as near-surface runoff in this study). Figure 9(b) documents the occurrence of this flow along streams in the valley at the East Fork \nJemez River. Ring fractures are hydrogeologically well developed at lower elevations, particularly on the northwestern side of Valles Caldera (Figure 1; (Goff and Gardner, 1994)). The ring fractures function as conduits to convey groundwater (Goff and Grigsby, 1982). The extensive, hydrogeologically active ring fractures in the northwestern Caldera explain why the relative contribution of groundwater is much higher at the San Antonio West catchment than at the East Fork Jemez River catchment (Figure 8). Flowpaths in snowmelt versus monsoon season A significant difference in flowpaths between the snowmelt and monsoon seasons is the higher relative contribution of near-surface runoff during spring snowmelt than summer monsoon (Figure 8). The contribution of near-surface runoff at the East Fork Jemez River was significant during the monsoon season only when there were significant rainfall events on consecutive days. The relative contribution of near-surface runoff was almost zero throughout the monsoon season at San Antonio West, even with the frequent and high-intensity rainfall events during August–September 2006 (Figure 8(a)), which was the wettest monsoon season on record in the southwestern USA (Lyon et al., this issue). Floods did occur after each intensive monsoon rainfall event, particularly in the fall of 2006, based on the observations of Vivoni et al. (this issue). However, the variability of daily mean reciprocal conductivity values was much suppressed during the monsoon season, except for 2 days on 4 and 5 August 2006 (Figure 8). This suppression suggests that the floods caused by monsoon rainfall are flashy and may last only hours, rather than days. Soil moisture was indeed lower and more variable during the monsoon season than the snowmelt period except for 2006 (Figure 4). Soil moisture was even more variable in top soils (<6 cm) than that measured 10 cm below during the monsoon season (Vivoni et al., this issue). Transpiration of trees such as juniper and mixed conifer in Valles Caldera is limited by temperature and soil water availability (McDowell et al., this issue). Photosynthetic activity of vascular plants generally increases following relatively large precipitation pulses or a series of small precipitation pulses (Huxman et al., 2004). All these observations indicate that vegetation dictates the generation of near-surface runoff during the monsoon season through evapotranspiration (ET). Both wetland and grassland plant species flourish during the monsoon season and occupy large areas of the low-lying valleys and along streams, in which near-surface runoff usually occurs during the snowmelt period (Figure 9(b)). While strong ET consumes soil moisture, the flourishing plants increase retention time of rainwater by trapping water and thus increase infiltration of rainwater. These two factors together dampen the magnitude of near-surface runoff contributions to streams during the monsoon season.', 'N/A', '248', 'Discussion: Headwaters versus large catchments, Flowpaths in snowmelt versus monsoon season', 6, '4', 'Multiple land-covers described', 'Multiple properties described', 'Geological types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 225, 246, 225, 9, 4, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', '[53] The hydrograph at both Martinelli and GL4 catchments suggests three distinct stages (Figure 9). Stage 1 is from the initiation of snowmelt to about day 155 (mid-May to early June), during which snowmelt is initiated and streamflow discharge is low (Figures 8a and 8b). Stage 2 is from day 156 to 200 (early June to mid-July), including a steeply rising limb in late spring to maximum discharge in early summer. Stage 3 spans from day 201 to about 270 (mid-July to late September), representing the main recession limb of hydrograph.\n5.3.1.1. Stage 1\n[54] Snowmelt occurs primarily in the near-channel portion of the lower watershed, where snowpack is relatively shallow. A portion of the first fraction of meltwater from the snowpack infiltrates soils and unconsolidated materials (Figure 9). The infiltrating snowmelt increases soil moistures and undergoes rapid kinetic reactions with subsurface materials [Williams et al., 1993; Mast et al., 1995; Campbell et al., 1995; Sueker et al., 2000]. Additionally, a portion of this snowmelt appears to flow directly into the stream channel, consistent with results of Campbell et al. [2002]. Solute concentrations in the stream channel increase in part because of the release of solutes from the seasonal snowpack in the form of an ionic pulse. The ionic pulse, in combination with low discharge, may explain why solute concentrations in streamflow are relatively high (Figure 2) when new water component contributes near 100% during this stage (Figure 5a).\n5.3.1.2. Stage 2\n[55] Snowmelt dramatically intensifies and streamflow discharge rapidly increases (Figure 2c). Soils become saturated and saturation-excess overland flow occurs near the stream channels [Williams et al., 1993]. Depression of solute concentration in this stage (Figure 2) may be a result of dilution of solute contents in subsurface flow (50–60%) by surface flow (40–50%) (Figure 8a). Complicating this interpretation is the potential role of seasonally frozen ground. The presence of seasonally frozen ground below the snow cover may reduce infiltration and facilitate surface flow. The potential role of seasonally frozen ground in the hydrology of high mountain catchments of the Colorado Front Range deserves more research [Clow et al., 2003].\n[56] Subsurface event water primarily occurs during this stage (Figures 5a and 8a). Delivery of subsurface event water may be rapid [Wels et al., 1991a, 1991b; Brown et al., 1999], probably within an hour at the Martinelli catchment [Caine, 1989]. This water may be routed directly to the stream channels in the form of lateral flow as a thin saturated layer above the saturated zone [Wels et al., 1991a, 1991b; Brown et al., 1999]. This water can also reach to bedrock and soil interface via vertical preferential pathways [Buttle and McDonnell, 2002], mix with old water in vadose zone and saturated zone [Buttle, 1994], and rapidly travel to stream channel with old water [McDonnell, 1990]. It is unclear at this time whether preferential pathways exist at the Martinelli catchment. To confirm which mechanism predominates, hydrograph separation alone appears to be insufficient [Buttle and Peters, 1997] and physical measurements may be needed in the future.\n5.3.1.3. Stage 3\n[57] Streamflow behaves in a typical recession pattern. A mixture of new water and old water dominates the first 30 days after which old water dominates at base flow conditions (Figure 5a). Base flow is assumed to be primarily released from the storage in fractured bedrock (Figure 9).\n', '5.3.1', '13', 'Conceptual Model of Source Waters and Flow Paths, Martinelli Catchment', 2, '12', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'Topography described', 'N', 'Unknown items identified', 'N', 226, 144, 227, 2, 1, 2),

Stage 3 spans from day 201 to about 270 (mid-July to late September), representing the main recession limb of hydrograph.\n5.3.2.1. Stage 1\n[58] Similar to the Martinelli catchment, meltwater may primarily infiltrate the ground during this stage (Figure 9). Different from the Martinelli catchment, soil water on hillslopes does not appear to contribute to streamflow. Base flow and old water may be primarily from fractured bedrock.\n5.3.2.2. Stage 2\n[59] Surface flow accounts for approximately 40% of streamflow (Figure 8b). Solute contents in subsurface flow are diluted by surface flow, resulting in depression of solute contents in streamflow (Figure 2). Water bodies occupy only 4% of the basin area [Meixner et al., 2000]. Direct melt on lake and stream surface is insufficient to account for surface flow. Surface flow may occur primarily in the form of saturation-excess overland flow on soils near lakes and between lake 4 and lake 5 (Figure 1). As snowmelt rate increases, saturated areas in soils may expand and thus surface flow increases.\n[60] Base flow peaks during the high-flow period at the GL4 catchment (Figure 7d), along with old water (Figure 5b). Subsurface flow matches old water in magnitude and in temporal pattern. Old water appears to be delivered via translatory flow, which is stored in the groundwater reservoir and released via a lateral through flow by a process of displacement by new water inputs [Hewlett and Hibbert, 1967; Buttle, 1994; McGlynn et al., 2002]. Sklash et al. [1986] indicates that translatory flow in the near-stream zone is considered to be responsible for the large (>75%) contribution of preevent water to storm flow from the Maimai catchment in New Zealand. McDonnell et al. [1991] provide further evidence through tensiometric measurements that the near-stream zone is often close to or at saturation.\n[61] Talus water is also a major contributor to the streamflow during this stage (Figure 7d). Burns et al. [2001] show that runoff from an outcrop of the forested Panola Mountain Research Watershed contributes more than 50% of the peak storm flow during two rainstorms. Similar to their results, our results demonstrate that the unique geographical setting of talus fields is important in controlling streamflow quantity and quality.\n5.3.2.3. Stage 3\n[62] Talus water continues to contribute to streamflow with an increasing proportion and relatively invariant discharge (Figure 8b). Discharge from base flow is also invariant, but with a much lower discharge than talus flow. At the end of the stage, base flow from fractured bedrock dominates the streamflow.', '5.3.2', '14', 'Conceptual Model of Source Waters and Flow Paths, GL4 Catchment', 2, '12', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'Topography described', 'N', 'Unknown items identified', 'N', 227, 79, 227, 2, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Our experimental study on moraine chronosequences in two proglacial areas in the Central Swiss Alps shows that despite the increase in vegetation cover, root density, and soil organic matter content, the saturated hydraulic conductivity decreased with moraine age due to the decrease in gravel and increase in silt and clay content. However, this did not affect the effective infiltration rates during the sprinkling experiments, which was high for all moraines and increased with rainfall intensity.\nThe peak OF ratios increased with moraine age and were largest for the oldest moraines on silicate bedrock, where OF was driven by flow along the dense root network and saturation-excess due to ponding above a lower permeability clay-rich layer at 20–40 cm below the soil surface. In the calcareous glacier forefield, however, OF did not occur on the old moraines during the intense sprinkling experiments, presumably because the clay-rich layers were less pronounced and the sprinkling experiments were too small to cause saturation. During larger (but lower intensity) natural rainfall events that exceeded the storage threshold, OF was observed for these moraines. OF occurred most frequently on the young moraines and was likely caused by saturation of the soil above stones and rocks that were buried near the surface, even-though the infiltration rate in the sediment between the stones was very high. The larger water storage in the soils of the older moraines, due to the higher water retention caused by the larger silt-, clay-, and organic matter content, resulted in more mixing of rainfall and soil water and a larger contribution of pre-event water to OF than for the younger moraines. The higher soil aggregate stability and vegetation cover—rather than differences in the OF volume or flow rates—caused the sediment fluxes to be lower for the old moraines than the young moraines.\nThese results, in combination with the changes in SSF (Maier et al., 2021), help us to understand how hillslope characteristics and runoff generation processes change during the first millennia of soil development and the interactions between these processes (cf. Figure 1). This is important for understanding the spatial and temporal changes in runoff generation in rapidly changing Alpine areas and can be used to inform landscape evolution models.', '6', '24', 'Conclusions', 2, '1', 'Vegetation described', 'Multiple properties described', 'Geological types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 228, 223, 228, 2, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The weak damping effect of the isotope ratios in streamflow compared to rainfall (Table 3; Figure S4) indicated a rapid runoff generation with limited isotope mixing in soils and groundwater, similar and even more pronounced than for other catchments in Costa Rica (Birkel et al., 2021). [...] Nonetheless, the TAM identified quickly draining water from the upper soil water storage at the hillslopes directly into the saturated riparian zone (Sánchez-Murillo, Romero-Esquivel, et al., 2019). From there, mostly unmixed water (Figure 6f,g with low mixing volume parameters MV) rapidly contributes to streamflow, as reflected by high values (Figure 6a,e) of the linear rate coefficients a (Flow from hillslope to riparian area; Table 2) and the non-linear parameter α (flow from riparian area to stream; Table 2). The most likely runoff generation mechanism is saturation excess overland flow and near-surface stormflow. In fact, field observations during sampling campaigns confirmed the prevalence of swamp areas near the riparian zones. Hortonian overland flow can be excluded due to the measured high infiltration capacities of the humic top soil layer that exceed the highest observed rainfall intensities in contrast to other small-scale catchments in Latin America (Chaves et al., 2008; Zimmermann et al., 2012). [...] The comparison of different calibration periods and storage parameters showed that only the upper hillslope has a larger mixing volume (Figure 6f), but that water passes too fast likely via preferential flow pathways to noticeably dampen the isotope output variability. [...] In our case, however, the hydrograph separation (Figure 8) indicated a constant but small contribution of water from a deeper substrate to the perennial stream (average BFI of 37% ± 22%; Figure 7b). The water balance showed a loss of water from our system (Table 4) indicating that a fraction of vertical water fluxes percolates into the highly fractured volcanic bedrock, and thus cannot be measured as streamflow at the catchment outlet. Evidence for re-emerging regional groundwater were found in the floodplains downstream of the study site using age dating tracers (Genereux et al., 2013) and modelling (Osburn et al., 2018; Zanon et al., 2014). [...] The low BFIs support the notion of a saturation excess surface runoff and shallow interflow dominated system (Sánchez-Murillo, Romero-Esquivel, et al., 2019). Interestingly, the BFIs in our study area were also much lower than observed for other catchments in Costa Rica (Birkel et al., 2012; Westerberg & Birkel, 2015) and other tropical catchments (Beck et al., 2013; Peña-Arancibia et al., 2010) which are commonly characterized by high groundwater contributions to total streamflow. Even in other fast responding catchments in Costa Rica, the flashy response in streamflow after storm events is characterized by mixing and dampening effects from available deeper soil and groundwater (Dehaspe et al., 2018). Therefore, our study site is a pristine catchment (Klaus & McDonnell, 2013) in the central American tropics that deviates from the old water paradox (Barthold & Woods, 2015; Sidle et al., 2000), that is, the rapid mobilization of previously stored “old” water via subsurface flow paths during storm events (Muñoz-Villers & McDonnell, 2012), resulting in strongly damped tracer output composition (Kirchner, 2003). Due to the young water dominance, short TTs and low groundwater contribution to streamflow, we, therefore, rejected our previously formulated working hypothesis.', '5.1', '11', 'Runoff generation and mixing in a very humid rainforest catchment', 6, '1', 'N', 'Soil types described', 'Geological types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 229, 39, 229, 2, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The work described above has shown that whilst the storm response of the instrumented catchment is in some ways typical of a dynamic source area around a stream head, two different types of quickflow source area exist within the catchment. These are: 1. Surface (saturated) stream head source area. 2. Sub-surface pipeflow source area. A third type of source area, saturated areas associated with pipe effluxes, was also found. The essential differences between the types of source area are their location, timing of contribution and type of flow generated. Pipe source areas occur on the flatter slope summit of the lithero Clough catchment. The stream head source area lies mainly in the topographic hollow around the perennial stream draining the catchment. Pipeflow contributions, accounting for up to 10 per cent of the volume of the quickflow hydrograph, are somewhat delayed compared to the contributions from the stream head source area. Terminology applied to dynamic source areas The two types of dynamic source area, termed thus far ‘stream head’ and ‘pipeflow’, found in the study catchment are difficult to describe using terms commonly applied to dynamic source areas. The area of surface soil saturation in the catchment is not equivalent to the total ‘source’ or ‘contributing’ area. In drawing attention to a similar spatial pattern of source areas Jones (1979) has suggested a variety of terms, emphasizing the necessity of a link between the channel and zones of saturation for such areas to contribute to the quickflow hydrograph. In the example studied here, however, such terms are largely redundant since the extensive pipe network ensures contribution from all pipeflow source areas. It is desirable to differentiate between types of source area on the basis of their nature and location. The source area types identified by this study are therefore most usefully termed: surface saturated (stream head) and subsurface (slope summit) source areas. The types of flow generated in these areas can be generally described as surface and subsurface quickflow.', 'N/A', '250', 'Summary of field observations', 3, '1', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'Slopes described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 230, 217, 230, 2, 2, 2),

These soils develop seasonal perched water tables (PWTs) under the xeric moisture regime of the region. The objective of this study was to utilize a hydropedology approach to examine the linkages between fragipans, PWTs, and catchment-scale hydrological processes such as soil water storage, runoff, and lateral throughflow. A 1.7-ha catchment dominated by Fragixeralfs (Fragic Luvisols) was instrumented with 135 automated shallow wells to monitor PWTs. Soil water content was measured with water content reflectometry probes, and catchment outflow was measured with a flume. A 35 m × 18 m plot was isolated hydrologically from the surrounding hillslope using tile drains and plastic sheeting to measure perched water outflow. Results show that during the wet winter and spring months, the transition from unsaturated to saturated conditions is accompanied by changes in volumetric water storage of only 4–5%. PWT levels are at the surface of ∼ 26–45% of the catchment soils during periods of high rainfall and snowmelt, thereby generating saturation-excess surface runoff from hillslopes. Observed solute movement via subsurface flow is very rapid and ranges between 2.9 and 18.7 m d− 1 when PWTs are maintained in more-permeable Ap and Bw horizons. Subsurface lateral flow accounts for as much as 90% of the incident precipitation and snowmelt during early spring.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', '[49] We examined the temporal dynamics of hillslope and catchment runoff responses using combined hydrometric, isotopic, and applied tracer approaches. We found that the hillslope runoff is nonlinearly related to the catchment runoff, hillslopes are capable of transporting solutes (tracer) to the stream from upslope areas over the time scale of a storm event, event water contributions are smaller for the hillslope than the catchment, and hillslope transit times can be longer than the catchment average. The nonlinear evolving relationship between hillslope runoff and streamflow through a wet-up period was controlled by moisture thresholds and expansion of saturated areas upslope. Saturated area expansion within a thin zone above weathered bedrock was inferred through soil moisture patterns, applied tracer breakthrough, large quick flow ratios, and previous studies at this site. Event water transit time distributions and rapid breakthrough from an applied upslope tracer addition, demonstrated that contributing areas extend far upslope during events. Despite these rapid transport processes and some contribution of event water from upslope regions, we found soil water and runoff mean transit times that were greater that the time scale of storm events. Soil water mean transit times exhibited no evidence of downslope aging and were between 10 and 25 days for shallow and deep soil, respectively. On the other hand, transit times of runoff from the hillslope and the catchment during nonstorm conditions were similarly between 1 and 2 years old.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'As summer changes to fall, a shift in the balance of evapotranspiration to precipitation causes the soil moisture in the catchment to switch from a dry state to a wet state. Thereafter, the onset of a snowpack reduces the downward advance of the wetting front. Unless the wetting front  reaches the deepest soil regions in the catchment during the transitional period, large-scale connectivity via lateral flow does not occur because dry pockets inhibit downslope flow along the soil–bedrock interface. Streamflow during the winter originates high up in southeast-facing  unchannelled gullies from direct input of new snowmelt. This dilute water picks up some solutes as it travels down the streambed, but it remains relatively dilute. The stream loses water to the underlying soil and a saturated wedge likely develops below the stream on the underlying granite. Meanwhile, localized connectivity grows via lateral flow along the bedrock interface in the shallow soils on the hillslopes near the ridgetops and streambed. Near-stream subsurface flow is independent of activities occurring higher in the slopes. When the deep midslope soils become wetted above field capacity, whole-slope hydraulic connectivity is established and upland soils are in direct connection with the near-stream soil moisture. Previously wetted upslope regions become hydraulically connected to downslope regions, raising the head in downslope regions due to the sudden connection to the higher heads in the upland soils. This can reverse the gradient in the substream saturated wedge and turn the losing stream into a gaining stream. This allows solutes from previously disconnected sources to enter the stream, causing a step increase in electrical conductivity of the streamwater. At this point, the source of solutes has not been identified. Solutes could be derived from hillslope regions or from the near-stream saturated wedge that has accumulated solutes through the winter. Regardless, as the catchment drains, the solute source continues to deliver concentrated water to the stream because basal connectivity is sustained', 'N/A', '4035', 'CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF THE LINK BETWEEN HYDRAULIC CONNECTIVITY AND RUNOFF GENERATION', 2, '1', 'N', 'N', 'Geological types described', 'Topography described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 233, 239, 233, 2, 1, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The mean groundwater levels and the groundwater response timing were correlated with topographic indices. This suggests that groundwater levels in depressions and the footslopes are high and respond quickly (Fig. 10b, letter G). The ridge sides respond later and less frequently. [...] The rise of the groundwater level into soil layers close to the soil surface with higher saturated hydraulic conductivity means that lateral, preferential flowpaths are activated and contribute water to the streams with only a short delay (Fig. 10b, letters E-G). Once lateral connectivity is established between the individual groundwater response areas and the channel network\n(Fig. 10b, number VII), the midslope areas also contribute to streamflow. [...] During these smaller events, the initial rise in streamflow is maybe not only generated by fast lateral flow from the hillslopes but the wetlands close to the streams also become more connected during events and also contribute pre-event water to streamflow [...] shallow subsurface flow from the near stream areas likely occurs throughout the year but that the midslope and ridge sites only become active and connected during larger events. Overall, these results suggest that the contributing areas  expand during rainfall events and that different areas of the catchment become connected and contribute to streamflow at different times. Groundwater will mainly deliver pre-event water to the stream but the preferential flow pathways in the near surface layers may deliver a mixture of event and pre-event water. T: Dye tracer tests in the Vogelbach catchment by Weiler et al. (1999) showed that preferential flow can be a source of event water. I think that these shallow pathways may get flushed during large events. H: Surface runoff also contributes some of the event water to the stream, although its isotopic composition and chemistry suggest that it is a mixture of event and pre-event water (Sauter, 2017). Saturation overland flow from the meadows and wetlands is important during rainfall events.

The CST test revealed that surface soils in the Japanesecypress forest exhibited water repellency as severe a sthat for soils at pine and eucalypt forests reported byprevious studies. 2. The spraying experiment proposed in this study provided direct evidence of soil water repellency causing Hortonian overland flow despite the high inherent infiltration capacity of the surface soils. 3. The surface runoff coefficient was negatively correlated with the initial soil moisture condition. This is considered to result from severe water repellency under dry conditions, which was reduced as the soil became wetter. 4. At the same time, successive storm events with  short inter-rainfall intervals reduced water repellency in the soil, resulting in a gradual decrease in the surface runoff coefficient despite similar initial soil moisture conditions. Thus, the water repellency did not depend only on soil moisture content but also on the history of rainfall at the site. 5. Longer rainfall intervals, high air temperature, and drier surface soils due to evapotranspiration, allowed strengthening of repellency in soils. This was associated with a gradual increase in the  surface runoff coefficient. 6. Decreases in soil water repellency were also detectedduring an individual storm event. On the basis of measurements of the surface runoff coefficient, water content, and soil water potential in surface soils, interactions between the soil water repellency and rainwater-infiltration/redistribution  processes  were clarified. In the beginning of a rainfall event, the soil water potential rapidly increased with small increase in water content, resulting in low hydraulic conductivity in the surface soil and surface runoff generation. As rainfall accumulating, infiltration water gradually reduced soil water repellency, resulting in increases in the soil water content. Thus, the surface runoff coefficient gradually decreased with increases in the infiltration rate. Finally,the effect of the soil water repellency became negligible.

In addition, focused infiltration and preferential flow in frozen soil enabled meltwater to bypass a portion of the soil profile and groundwater recharge prior to ground thaw. Field data suggested that the refreezing of infiltrated meltwater during midwinter snowmelt enhanced runoff generation in frozen grassland soils, highlighting the feedback effect of previous melt events on later snowmelt event partitioning.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The main elements of the model are (1) the andosols located in the slopes, (2) the histosols (wetlands) located at the valley bottom, and (3) the mineral horizon and fractured top layer of bedrock. Our observations indicate that subsurface flow through the soils’ organic horizons dominates the ecohydrology of this ecosystem. In addition, although water originating from histosols (wetlands) is the main source of runoff generation throughout the year, the processes controlling water delivery to the drainage network vary with streamflow regime. During the generation of low flows (Figure 9a), we hypothesize that discharge generation is dominated by the gravitational potential of water draining subsurface in the andosols. This water tends to move laterally in the shallower part of the organic horizon at the middle of the slope and vertically at its bottom before reaching the histosols. Water that reaches the bottom of the slope not only recharges the reservoir of the histosols but also pushes forward the water stored in them, maintaining sustained flows throughout the year and particularly during less humid periods (August to October). Contributions from the mineral horizon and top fractured bedrock vary with the geomorphological setting of the catchments, as illustrated by higher low flows observed in two of the smaller catchments (M3 and M4). During the generation of moderate and high flows (Figure 9b) in more humid periods, we hypothesize that histosols are directly recharged by infiltrated rainfall (new or event water), where new water pushes old stored water in histosols forward into streams. This process indicates hydrologic connectivity between wetlands and the drainage network. In this case, although we would expect that rainfall water also recharges andosols storage, we hypothesize that the gravitational potential of the andosols becomes less important to discharge generation. An alternative explanation could be that even when the andosols are recharged by infiltrated rainfall, their gravitational potential is still important, and the delivery of water to the streams is a combination of such potential and the piston flow mechanism (Horton and Hawkins, 1965) taking place in the histosols. For these flow regimes, the contributions from the mineral horizon (if any) are minimal with respect to total water yield. In addition, the combination of high antecedent soil moisture and rainfall of very high intensity leads to the generation of saturation excess overland flow, although this is rare in the Zhurucay observatory because of the year-round low intensity and low seasonality of rainfall.', 'N/A', '2942', 'Conceptualization of ecohydrological processes', 2, '1', 'Wetland described', 'Soil types described', 'Geological types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 238, 273, 238, 2, 2, 2),

Rather, our combined hydrometric-isotopic-chemical tracer analysis suggests that vertical percolation of rainfall through the highly permeable volcanic soils and underlying substrate, and the progressive recharge of groundwater sources are the key hydrological processes controlling the amount, timing, and composition of subsurface storm runoff through the wetting-up cycle during the wet season. [...] [48] Isotope-inferred mean residence time estimates showed that soil water aged vertically up to 6 months through the ∼120 cm soil profiles across all hillslope locations. In addition, soil water showed a lagged and damped isotopic response to rainfall with increasing soil depth. These findings suggest that infiltrating rainwater flows predominantly vertically through the soil to deeper layers where contributions to groundwater recharge are likely occurring by water that bypasses the soil matrix. [...] [51] We found that at low antecedent wetness conditions, the Q/P ratio for the first storm was very small and yielded high new event water volumes produced likely by direct channel precipitation (Figure 8). Soil surface dryness could have augmented this event water contribution via seasonal hydrophobicity that may have developed following the dry season (as noted by Buttle and Turcotte [1999]). This, combined with the high rainfall intensity of this first storm (33 mm/h; maximum I60) likely contributed to produce some overland flow and/or pseudo overland flow [McDonnell et al., 1991a, 1991b], resulting in the initial high event water response. [...]\n[52] As catchment wetness progressed, new event water contributions to stormflow for the two consecutive rain storms diminished rapidly and shifted toward a dominance of pre-event water, where groundwater sources had the greatest contribution to flow. We observed increases of soil moisture content levels and establishment of groundwater tables in and around the near-stream valley extending upslope within our monitored groundwater well area to lower midslope hillslope positions. Although we lack measurements of the details of subsurface flow process response internal to the catchment, we hypothesize that the shallow sources were generated from subsurface flow at the near-stream valley areas along the stream channel, where hydraulic conductivities are reduced due to decreases in soil depth (Figure 8). The deeper flow contribution seems to be provided by groundwater from within the permeable weathered volcanic breccias-saprolite substrate (Figure 8), as the isotopic composition of sample groundwater from our wells completed in the permeable weathered volcanic breccias-saprolite was effectively the same in composition as stream base flow prior to the storm (seesection 4.2.2).\n[53] At high antecedent wetness, storm runoff response to the last 3 rain events produced the highest Q/Pratios and the highest pre-event water contributions, the latter of which were almost entirely dominated by groundwater sources. At this wetness stage, it is striking how the stream catchment reacted to the most intense rain event registered during the study period (Storm 5), categorized as an extreme event that occurs every 1–2 times during a year based on our 5-year observation period (F. Holwerda, unpublished data, 2012). Despite its short duration (∼4 h), very high rain intensity (61 mm/h; maximumI60) and the high antecedent precipitation conditions (API15 = 311 mm), the storm runoff was characterized by the highest observed groundwater contribution with no evidence of shallow stormflow sources.', '5', '12', 'Discussion', 4, '3', 'N', 'Soil types described', 'Geological types described', 'N', 'N', 'Limitations discussed', 'N', 239, 2, 239, 2, 10, 2),

Throughout most of the year, the flow system has two domains a macropore domain, in which water can move relatively rapidly and in which evapotranspiration has a minor effect, and a matrix domain, in which water movement is extremely slow and transpiration has a major effect, resulting in substantial water loss and increased salt concentrations. When the soils are at or near saturation (greater than -33% volumetric water content) during snowmelt periods, a connection between the two domains is established, and concentrations of chloride, organic carbon, and other aqueous species in lateral subsurface flow rise dramatically. Under these conditions, very large volumes of lateral subsurface flow can be produced.

Eventually, given sufficient input of water, the entire soil profile can become saturated as an increasing number of root macropores begin flowing, and saturation extends outward from these macropores. Deeper horizons may also become saturated in part by downward matrix flow originating in the A horizon. The combined effects of the hydrologic properties of the soil and the distribution and density of ponderosa pine roots control the generation of lateral subsurface flow and development of saturated zones.

During dry conditions, the streamflow hydrograph declined rapidly after the storms ceased. This resulted in low stormflow volume to storm period rainfall ratios and suggests that the rain water was mostly retained in the soil. As soil moisture conditions became wetter, the hydrograph volume became larger with gentler recession limbs.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Evidence for run-on from the irrigation network was observed throughout the first wet season but not the second, as the severe drought constrained irrigation by the farmers. The main runoff generation process was saturation-excess; infiltration-excess only appeared to be important for isolated events, as maximum rainfall intensities were generally below saturated hydraulic conductivity. This is consistent with data for cultivated fields in northern Spain (e.g. Giménez et al., 2012). However, runoff generation depended more on antecedent rainfall (especially in the previous 5 days) than on initial soil moisture. Pereira et al. (2007) reported a similar dependence for other terraces in northern Portugal, and proposed a conceptual model for terraces overlaying granite bedrock, where saturation-excess runoff generation is linked with groundwater, through: (i) presence of a shallow water table resulting from a delay in drainage caused by the terrace wall; and (ii) groundwater resurfacing in downhill terraces, caused by pressure from this water table in uphill terraced fields. A shallow water table could be present in the field at depths below those of the soil moisture measurements (i.e. below 10 cm). In fact, the terrace walls limiting the downslope part of the experimental field usually remained humid after rainstorms, possibly due to the water they retained. [...] The shallow water table could have been created by winter irrigation, typical of this “águas de lima” system, in combination with antecedent rainfall. The winter drought of 2011/2012 limited available water for irrigation, possibly resulted in a lower shallow water table; this would explain why runoff generation in April and May 2012 involved higher rainfall thresholds than previous events (Figure 7). As for groundwater re-surfacing, little evidence for this process was observed in this study, except for the decreasing soil moisture gradient with slope found at a single occasion. It is however possible that this process could be more important for terraced fields downhill from the study site. [...] Most of the 12 major storms revealed evidence for run-on from the irrigation network, except for the ones in April and May 2012 when the irrigation system was not used (Figure 7). Even so, only the storm of 06 December 2010 presented evidence for substantial run-on, suggesting that this process may only be important for infrequent events, and can therefore be thought of as a complementary process to the shallow water table.', 'N/A', '603', 'Hydrological Processes', 1, '5', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 246, 132, 246, 1, 1, 2),

As the wet season progressed (Fig. 8b), the shallow perched aquifer rapidly developed at mid-slope locations due to preferential recharge, which resulted in dilution of Cl−. Nitrate is not leached by infiltrating water, rather rising water tables intersect rich soil water, thereby increasing concentrations in the shallow perched aquifer first in mid-slope locations, and later in upland locations since they have different water table dynamics and are as yet hydrologically disconnected. Over the wet season (Fig. 8c) the shallow aquifer appears to transport large amounts of from the upland source areas to mid-slope locations since a well-established spatial gradient in concentrations across the hillslope is observed, indicating that all three parts of the hillslope are now fully connected. This connection results in high velocities in the subsurface flow that ensure the supply of , thus triggering denitrification in the riparian zones. Later on, over the spring season (Fig. 8d), the water table level declines at all locations across the hillslope, with a faster rate at mid-slope and riparian zone locations. At this time, the lowered water tables at the upland locations cause a disconnection with mid-slope locations (with an apparent principal direction of water movement vertical downward) and there is no longer adequate water supply from the uplands to sustain mid-slope water levels. Consequently, the supply to mid-slope locations effectively stops.

Small storms resulted in low runoff coefficients (Fig. 4) and stormflow generation was likely related to the response of the near-stream riparian zone that was prone to saturation and reactive to precipitation. The increase in stormflow with precipitation was 9% of the precipitation, which suggested that stormflow could volumetrically be explained by\nthe contribution of the entire riparian zone (representing approximately 9% of the total catchment area). Streamflow and soil moisture were very sensitive to rainfall inputs whereas groundwater was less reactive (Fig. 3). Streamflow response was faster than soil moisture measured on the hillslope, resulting in a clockwise hysteretic relationship between the two variables (Fig. 8a).\n(ii) As wetness increased, saturation in the riparian zone likely expanded laterally to the lower parts of hillslopes that are characterized by gentle slopes and shallow soils. Experimental evidence is not available to support this view but such a behaviour could be assumed based on a comparison of the topographic and geomorphologic properties of BCC with those of the Hitachi Ohta Watershed (e.g., incised morphology, shallow soils, steep slopes).\n(iii) With further increasing wetness, a moisture threshold was exceeded, resulting in a marked increase of streamflow (Fig. 5a) and likely the triggering of transient lateral subsurface flow on the hillslopes (Fig. 5b) as suggested by the abrupt increase in runoff coefficients above the 45% soil moisture threshold (Fig. 4) and the much larger increase in runoff depth with increasing precipitation (Fig. 9). A connection was likely established between the riparian area and hillslopes, which became hydrologically active zones. Response times changed compared to dry conditions: hillslope soil moisture peaked before streamflow, resulting in an anticlockwise hysteretic loop (Fig. 8b).

A saturatedlayer consisting of event and preevent water forms above the bedrock over large portions of upslope areas in the basin, initiated by mixing of event water fluxes via macropore flow with soil water immediately above the bedrock and production of phreatic conditions. DOC results suggest that saturation doesnot occur by mixing of event and preevent water in the upper soil matrix and piston-type displacement of this water to the bedrock, since this would result in DOC levels in BR flow similar to those in the matrix soil water. Instead, high DOC concentrations in initial flow at the soil-bedroc kinterface provide strong evidence for mixing of DOC-rich event water with a thin layer of preevent water and subsequent rapid movement of this mixture along the soil-bedrock interface to the near-stream zone.

Daily variability is attributable to a network of ephemerally saturated zones (macropores) at shallow (<1 m) depths [14], which appear to transmit precipitation inputs to stream channels on average within a day. However, precipitation events often last for multiple days, and soils are deep and fine-textured, so they may store considerable moisture and release it over many days, weeks, and months after a precipitation input. Multi-day and monthly scale variation in streamflow at Andrews also may be due to the accumulation and melt of a transient snowpack (at low elevations) or a seasonal snowpack (at high elevations) [15], [30] (see also Harr [16]). Seasonal variability of precipitation inputs (which does not occur at the other sites) creates pronounced seasonal variability in streamflow. Multi-year cycles in precipitation also are evident in the precipitation and streamflow record. In addition, spatial variability in hydrologic response is attributable to differences in the degree of weathering of underlying volcanic substrates, as well as to spatial variation in the types and styles of mass movements [42]. [...] The conifer forest canopy at Andrews has a strong hydrologic role at daily and seasonal timescales, and its role varies with elevation. Forests were never cleared at the Andrews basins in this study, but they were affected by fire 450 and 150 years ago [45]. The forest canopy is structurally complex, and interception and transpiration may be controlled in certain seasons by deciduous trees (e.g. vine maple, Acer circinatum) and evergreen shrubs (e.g. Arctostaphylus, Ceanothus and Rhodedendron spp.) in understory gaps [10], [13], [40]. Canopy interception may be very important in fall and spring when rainfall events are relatively short, and during winter snow events, especially at high elevations. Also, in fall and spring, conifer canopies are actively transpiring and visibly influence soil moisture and streamflow. In summer, a period of soil moisture stress at Andrews, we infer that the forest canopy may be less hydrologically important than understory vegetation, perhaps because of greater sensitivity to vapor pressure deficits or low leaf water potentials. [...] At the Andrews and Hubbard Brook, seasonal snowpacks store and release soil moisture at a time closer to the time of summer vegetation physiological activity than would be possible otherwise, especially given the limited soil moisture storage capacities at Hubbard Brook. [...] Extremely rapid hydrologic responses at Luquillo and the Andrews are suggestive of rapid shallow subsurface saturated flow in macropores. [...] Intermediate responses, i.e. baseflow contributions for up to a month on average, at Coweeta high elevation and Andrews basins suggest that water may also be stored and drained from relatively fine-textured soil matrices. The most protracted hydrologic responses, i.e. water release over many months or even years at Luquillo, low-elevation Coweeta, and Andrews basins imply that these basins have the longest flowpaths through deep, fine-textured soil or fractured bedrock.', '4', '1205', 'Discussion', 2, '3', 'Vegetation described', 'Soil described', 'Geological types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 254, 247, 257, 4, 1, 2),

Hydrologic response was dominated by monthly and multi-year variability at low elevations but by daily and monthly variabilities at high elevations. Much of the variability in hydrologic response is attributable to differences in rainfall amount, soil depth (soil water storage and release) and topography [17], [19], [44]. The low elevation response is attributable to the deep, relatively fine textured soils, which apparently require up to two days to transmit precipitation inputs to stream channels, and may continue to contribute water as baseflow for up to 5 months. The high elevation response is attributable to relatively shallow, coarser-textured soils that transmit precipitation inputs to the stream channel on average within one day, but only contribute baseflow for up to 2 months. [...] At Coweeta, deciduous forest canopies play an important, temporally and spatially varying role: in winter when canopies are leafless, their hydrologic role may be dominated by interception (possibly including some snow interception at high elevations), whereas in summer they exert a strong hydrologic influence through water uptake. Forests at Coweeta were affected by fire and windthrow 150 years ago, cultivation and grazing 80–100 years ago, and extensive logging 75 years ago [4], [5], and the current second-growth forests are dominated by deciduous species. Because of soil depth and soil moisture availability, combined with the short period when the forest is in leaf, actual evapotranspiration accounts for only 25–40% of precipitation on a mean annual basis at high-elevation basins with shallow soils, but over 50% at the low-elevation basins with deep soils.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Headwater basins at Hubbard Brook had the simplest hydrologic regimes of the basins in this study: their hydrologic response was dominated by variability at two scales: daily and monthly (Table 6). Daily scale responses are attributable to the timing of precipitation inputs (dominated by single-day events spaced by relatively dry intervals) combined with the shallow, coarse-textured soils and relatively steep slopes, which appear to transmit most water inputs rapidly to stream channels. The monthly scale, lagged response (Fig. 5), and the strong coupling of streamflow to precipitation at the annual timescale (Table 5) are attributable to the accumulation and melt of a seasonal snowpack, combined with the tendency of the soils to rapidly transmit snowmelt to channels. The basins at Hubbard Brook are spatially homogenous in their hydrologic behavior, perhaps because they were shaped by recent (Holocene) glaciation. [...] At Hubbard Brook, deciduous forest canopies play a dual hydrologic role. During the months when dominant forest vegetation is leafless, its hydrologic role is principally exerted through interception (primarily of snow), whereas during summer months, the interception role of the forest canopy may be less important than its water uptake (evapotranspiration).

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Headwater basins at Luquillo (the Bisley basins) had a somewhat more complex hydrologic regime than Hubbard Brook: hydrologic response at Luquillo was dominated by variability at two scales: daily and multi-year (Table 6). The daily scale responses are attributable to short precipitation inputs, which include daily orographic storms, whose inputs are transmitted on the scale of hours to stream channels by shallow saturated flow through numerous macropores in the upper 0.5 m of soil in these small (<10 ha) basins (F. Scatena, pers. comm.). Annual and interannual scale responses are attributable to moisture storage in the very deep (9 m) clay soils, which appears to be slowly released into stream channels as baseflow. Multi-year variability also was expressed more strongly at Luquillo (Bisley) than at other sites; this may be attributable to variation in precipitation inputs associated with ocean and atmospheric dynamics that affect the periodicity of hurricanes. Basins at Luquillo (Bisley) are spatially homogenous in their hydrologic behavior, because they are spaced at less than 0.5 km from one another. [...] Tropical rainforest canopies play an important role at daily and annual timescales at Luquillo. Evergreen broadleaf vegetation at Luquillo has a high leaf area to intercept precipitation, and is able to evapotranspire year-round because of uniform high air temperatures; hence actual evapotranspiration accounts for 50% of mean annual precipitation. The forest is regularly bathed in moist marine air masses, and intercepts over 40% of rainfall [35]. The Bisley basins have never been completely deforested but did support shade coffee 80–100 years ago and selective logging 75 years ago. Six hurricanes passed over Puerto Rico in the past century, two of which (in 1932 and 1989) passed directly over Luquillo [9]. In 1989 the basins were completely defoliated by the hurricane and were recovering during the period of this study [38]. The post-1989 hurricane forest canopy at Luquillo is irregular, with emergent tabonuco trees on ridgetops, and an understory of palms and woody vegetation with leaf area indices ranging from 2 in ravines to 12 on ridgetops [39]. During daily showers, forest canopies may intercept very large portions of precipitation inputs [39]), whereas on a multi-year basis they have an extremely rapid recovery of water use following natural disturbances such as hurricanes [38].

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'From the results of recent studies (e.g. Hayashi et al., 2004; Quinton et al., 2003), a conceptual model of runoff generation for the wetland-dominated basins of the lower Liard River valley has begun to develop. Peat plateaus represent areas of saturated permafrost that rise above the surrounding terrain. This enables them to effectively impound water in the bogs, while re-directing flow in the fens. Owing to their relatively high topographic position and the limited water storage capacity within their active layer, peat plateaus also shed water to the surrounding wetlands. The flowpath then followed by this drainage water depends upon the type of wetland that receives it. Water entering channel fens is more likely to be conveyed toward the basin outlet, than water entering bogs. This conceptual model contributes to resolving some of the difficult issues in the hydrological modelling of northern basins, especially in relation to the storage and routing functions of wetlands. Runoff-generation algorithms in hydrological models must account for the storage capacity of the bogs. Similarly, routing algorithms in distributed hydrological models need to incorporate the network of channel fens. Preliminary studies suggest that surface roughness and channel slope may be the essential factors controlling the flow of surface water in channel fens.', 'N/A', '62', 'SUMMARY AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS', 3, '1', 'Wetland described', 'N', 'N', 'Topography described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 258, 209, 258, 8, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Field studies at Scotty Creek have focussed on the permafrost plateaus, given their relatively wide coverage and importance for runoff generation. Vertical profiles of saturated hydraulic conductivity (K) measured on a permafrost plateau exhibit uniformly high and low K in the upper and lower regions of the profile respectively, separated by a transition zone in which K decreases abruptly with depth (Figure 4). A similar depth-dependence of K was observed in other organic-covered terrains near Whitehorse, Yukon and at Siksik Creek near Inuvik, NWT (Quinton et al., 2008). Therefore, it appears to be a common feature of peat, in which K is strongly controlled by the pore size that decreases with depth as a result of the  decomposition of organic materials. The subsurface drainage from permafrost plateaus to their adjacent bogs and fens strongly depends on the depth of ground thaw, as the frozen soil is relatively impermeable to water. When the subsurface flow zone (i.e., thawed, saturated layer) is near the ground surface the flow rate is high, but as the soil thaws (i.e., frost table lowers) and the water table depth increases, the flow rate diminishes (Figure 4). The rate of soil thaw is influenced by soil moisture, as wet peat is a better conductor of energy from the ground surface to the thawing front (i.e., frost table) than dry peat (Hayashi et al., 2007). This is illustrated by the comparison of frost-table depths measured at the end of summer (late August-early September) and the amount of total water input (snowmelt and summer rain) over seven years of measurements at an instrumented permafrost plateau (Figure 5). The frost table depths were significantly correlated to the total water input, with deeper frost table in years with greater water inputs, than in years with lower precipitation depths. Other factors, such as the length of the snow-free season produced weaker correlations with thaw depth. The spatial pattern of soil thaw over a permafrost plateau is also affected by the spatial pattern of soil moisture. Detailed spatial surveys of the instrumented permafrost plateau showed that frost table depths were greater in locations with higher soil moisture content (Wright et al., 2009). As a result, the frost table forms an irregular topography, which controls the lateral flow of water sourced by infiltration and ice melt within the active layer. Under this condition, modelling runs on a 5 × 5 m plot indicate that runoff is generated only when frost table depressions are filled and become interconnected to form a continuous subsurface drainage pathway (Wright et al., 2009), similar to the “fill and spill” effects observed in  other regions (Spence and Woo, 2003; Tromp-van Meerveld and McDonnell, 2006).', 'N/A', '316', 'Runoff Generation on Permafrost Plateaus', 1, '2', 'N', 'Soil hydraulic properties described', 'N', 'Topography described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 259, 209, 259, 1, 8, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Measurements of rainfall, stemflow, and throughfall at Caspar Creek indicate that approximately 22.4% of the rainfall in this 120-year-old redwood forest is stored by foliage and bark and evaporates before it reaches the litter layer. More than half of the water contributing to total interception loss is intercepted after the initial wet-up period during a storm, either to evaporate during the storm or to be held in storage for evaporation after the storm. Because leaf-area indices are relatively high in coniferous forests, the surface area of wetted foliage is large during storms, so low evaporation rates (per unit area of water surface) can lead to large volumes of water evaporated (per unit area of ground surface). Nevertheless, interception rates observed during periods of intense rainfall appear to be too high to be explained by in rain evaporation alone, even if all foliage surfaces are wetted. An additional component of in-rain interception might be accounted for by absorption by bark. Because the water storage capacity in bark is quite large in the Caspar Creek forest, the amount of rainfall absorbed by bark during most storms is expected to be roughly proportional to the amount of rain encountering the bark. The volume of water sequestered per unit time would thus increase with rainfall intensity, while the proportion of rainfall intercepted would remain relatively constant, as observed. Comparison of the timing of throughfall relative to rainfall in a nearby clearing indicates that the volume of water in storage in the canopy varies with rainfall intensity. Static storage in foliage is estimated to be about 1 mm, while the dynamic component of foliar storage can be as high as 2.4 mm. During periods of high-intensity rain, total foliar storage is therefore expected to exceed 3 mm. Water balance calculations suggest that interception loss accounted for about half the annual evapotranspiration in the North Fork Caspar Creek watershed when it supported a 120-year-old redwood forest (Table 4). About 68% of the annual evapotranspiration occurs during the October–April wet season, and during this time interception accounts for about two-thirds of the loss.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'A conceptualization of BFLW and stormflow formation (Figure 8) provides an insight on how slopes, wetlands and GWs interact to generate streamflow. Some of the rainwater recharges the hillslope GW and becomes further enriched in SiO2. This water either mixes with the GW in the granitic sediments below the histosols, or bypasses the peatland and contributes directly to the stream. Alternatively, the hillslope return flow is conducted in both man-made and natural surface channels to the stream. This mechanism confirms previous findings on the important role of the soil profile and the weathered layer above the bedrock (laterite and regolith) on the hillslope in run-off formation during events (Šanda et al., 2009; Hrnčíř et al., 2010). We hypothesize that the soil profile (SW) and the layers of weathered bedrock (GW) on hillsopes combine preferential flow with slower soil matrix flow, with the result that water is stored and its SiO2 content increases (Vogel et al., 2010b; Dusek et al., 2012). The preferential flow persists, but the soil matrix produces a slower flow and thus a stronger enrichment in SiO2. [...] We support the hypothesis that the streamflow in Uhlířská catchment is dominated by subsurface flow, which has seasonally variable proportions of hillslope pore water (depending on antecedent soil moisture), the peatland and GW weathered bedrock inflow. Patterns of δ18O revealed the dominant snowmelt origin of the valley perennial GW below the histosols, whereas patterns of SiO2 elucidated the dominant role of the SW peat GW system in the generation of the run-off events. It appears that the perennial GW in deluviofluvial sediments, primarily recharged via snowmelt, supplies the stream in winter periods where the wetland is hydrologically nearly inactive. In rain and snowmelt periods, however, event water also supplies the stream through the bottom of the hillslope soil profile and preferential flow through the upslope saturated soil-weathered bedrock interface. This explains why the stream BFLW is isotopically more variable than the GW and peatland water. The wetland appears to be predominantly GW-supplied, as its SiO2 concentration is close to the range of SiO2 concentration in the perennial GW.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The very rapid responses, high SSC concentrations and mostly clockwise hysteresis responses of all the pipes and the W3 stream are consistent with the idea that pipes provide much of the stream sediment load and storm runoff. The more rapid response of the W7 pipe than the W3 pipe to rainfall may reflect a shorter travel path from the smaller catchment area of the entirely piped W7 catchment. [...] Evidence from hydrograph form analysis and records of peak flow of the W3 pipe suggest that the pipe has a transmission capacity of approximately 2.8 L s−1, but that during very high magnitude and intensity rainstorms the threshold may be exceeded with peak discharges reaching 4.3 L s−1. A possible explanation is that during smaller intensity and magnitude storms the pipe''s discharge is constrained by a low connectivity between pipe and macropore segments in the catchment but during larger intensity and magnitude storms as soil moisture increases pipe and macropore segments become more connected thereby increasing the contributing area of the pipe allowing pipeflow discharge to exceed 2.8 L s−1. Sidle et al. (2000) proposed the existence of such preferential flow networks of macropores that expand in a stepped, non-linear manner as soil moisture (antecedent wetness) increased to explain stormflow generation in a temperate forest soil. An alternative explanation is that pipe transmission capacity may be stable only over comparatively short periods but subject to episodic change when pipe blockages (leading to a reduction in transmission capacity) or pipe enlargement or dam-bursts (leading to an increase in transmission capacity) occur, particularly in large storm events when pipeflow hydrostatic pressures and positive pore water pressures in soil material may be exceptionally high. [...] The speed with which pipeflow is generated in both the W3 and W7 catchments cannot be explained by vertical infiltration and percolation through the soil matrix, as measured hydraulic conductivities (Ksat values) are not high enough to allow infiltrating rainfall to penetrate to pipe depths in a sufficiently short time period to generate the observed peaks in pipeflow. The speed of pipe response implies a preferential flow mechanism, in which vertical cracks, roots and root-holes (perhaps concentrated around tree-trunks and therefore systematically missed by hydraulic conductivity assessments), small pipe-roof collapses and animal holes provide conduits for infiltrating water (including localised overland flow) to bypass the soil matrix. Models such as TOPMODEL, which are based on an assumption that soil hydrological response is governed by permeabilities of a layered soil matrix, are not appropriate to the storm runoff processes found in such monitored catchments, which are dominated by preferential flow, pipeflow and also, to some extent, Hortonian overland flow.', '5.3-5.5', '128', 'Discussion and Implications ', 2, '2', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'Multiple interpretations demonstrated', 'N', 262, 248, 262, 10, 3, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Rain intensities never exceeded the estimated infiltrability in forest and soybeans (Fig. 5, panel A) and ruled out Hortonian overland flow (HOF) as relevant runoff generating process. In pasture, median infiltrability was exceeded by 5% of all storms for at least one 5-min interval. This indicates that ponding, and therefore HOF, may occur occasionally in some places in pasture. The lack of connectivity with stream channels restricts this to occasional occurrences of short-lived flow largely along cattle tracks (Elsenbeer et al., 1999). [...] Depending on surface characteristics and storm features (most notably intensity, amount and frequency) the Ksat of the sub-surface soil increments determines at which depth a perched water table, and hence, lateral flowpaths may develop, leading in turn to sub-surface storm flow (SSF) or, in case of saturation up to the soil surface, saturation overland flow (SOF) (Bonell and Gilmour, 1980, Bonell et al., 1991). Rain intensities never exceeded the estimated Ksat at any depth in the forest plots (Fig. 5, panels B and C). Thus, our results indicated a total dominance of vertical flowpaths in forest over the whole investigated depth interval. This behavior agrees with other studies on Oxisols in the Amazon region, which pointed out the dominance of vertical drainage in undisturbed forested areas (e.g., Nortcliff and Thornes, 1989, Williams and Melack, 1997). In pasture, Ksat12.5 was exceeded by MaxI5 of 5% of all storms (Fig. 5, panel B), the same percentage as at the soil surface. Because permeability did not change within the upper soil increment but slightly increased to 30 cm depth (Fig. 3), we expect rather HOF than SSF but only within the strongest 5% of storms. Hence, for pasture we expect clearly vertical dominated drainage and a very limited lateral flow component mainly as HOF. Under soybean, the situation differed slightly. Permeability decreased persistently from the surface to 30 cm (Fig. 3). Consequently, not the soil properties at surface or near surface are most important for the flowpath patterns, as it was in pasture, but the subsoil characteristics, e.g., the occurrence of an impeding layer. MaxI5 of only 4% of the storms exceeded Ksat12.5 but the MaxI5 of 17% of storms and the MaxI15 of 6% of all storms exceeded Ksat30 (Fig. 5, panels B, C). This indicated that for these stronger storms soybean fields formed perched water tables at 30 cm depth and generated SSF, though, variations in the impeding behavior of the horizon and the absence of slope may partially avoid this flow. For all the other storms (as well as the times with lower intensities) vertical flowpaths under soybeans were expected. To evaluate the probability of the generation of SOF we specifically analyzed the plots that showed the lowest Ksat. For these plots, Fig. 6 illustrates the comparison of median Ksat and rain intensities and allows fast referencing of the mean number of storms per year that exceeded Ksat. In the case of S2 (lowest Ksat), the level of median Ksat30 (50 mm/h) was exceeded by MaxI15 of 15 storms, by MaxI30 of 6 storms, and by MaxI60 of less than 1 storm per year. Maximum possible amounts during 15, 30, and 60 min were 29.5, 47.3 and 61.5 mm, respectively. This indicates that the cultivation of soybeans on former pastures has the potential occasionally to activate lateral flowpaths. However, the available water retention of the soil (total pore space in 20 cm depth under S2 was 43.5%, F. Bäse et al., unpublished data, 2008) and the relatively short duration of high-intensity rainfall during storms suggest that the generation of relevant SOF is unlikely even in circumstances of sufficient rainfall duration and antecedent soil moisture. Bearing in mind that S2 was the most extreme case, this finding can likely be generalized to both land uses – pasture and soybean. [...] Our results still suggest that the cultivation of soybeans on former pastures has the potential to activate lateral flowpaths more frequently.', '4.3', '286', 'Permeabilities vs. storm intensities – expected runoff mechanisms', 3, '2', 'Vegetation described', 'N', 'N', 'Slopes described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 263, 224, 263, 8, 6, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The present results suggest a picture of a catchment whose storm response is dominated by fast flow paths. The rapid decay of saturated hydraulic conductivity with depth (Table 1) clearly allows only small quantities of water to percolate to the deeper parts of the soil profile. The continuous decrease in soil moisture with depth below 3Ð5 m underlines this further (Figure 3C, CF Larsen and Torres-Sanches, 1990). The combination of the above and the topography in parts of the catchment favours rapid lateral flow through the uppermost soil horizon (subsurface storm flow, SSSF). The discrepancy between results obtained with different methods for the measuring of saturated hydraulic conductivity in the topsoil, in this and other studies in the Bisley area (McDowell et al., 1992), suggests that abundant macropores and a pronounced soil structure are the primary reasons for the relatively high conductivity of the topsoil (Table 1). Another source of rapid flow in the area is SOF. This type of flow is favoured by a rapidly decreasing hydraulic conductivity with depth, which allows a perched water table to develop easily, especially under high rainfall conditions (Bonell and Gilmour, 1978). At places where SSSF converges, such as in hillslope hollows, return flow (RF) may emerge, which again causes SOF, showing that the two flow types can be closely linked (Dunne, 1978, Elsenbeer and Cassel, 1990). The mixing model results presented in Figure 10 and 11 point to return flow (as measured in a tributary gully) as the main contributor to quick runoff. Additional hydrometric evidence (Figure 6) supports this contention. However, SOF (including precipitation onto already saturated areas) may also account for a significant portion of the quickflow at Bisley, especially during large events. Although the choice of end members and constituents used in the flow separation procedure influences the results considerably (CF Figures 10 and 11), it is clear that fast flow paths comprise an important part of the storm hydrograph at Bisley. Nevertheless, the baseflow percentage inferred for the smaller of the two sampled events is still considerable (56% on average, versus 20% for the large event). As discussed earlier, a flaw in the present application of the mixing model is the fact that we have not been able to sample the deep source of the baseflow directly. Two sources remain possible candidates: (i) soil water that flows along the weathering front before entering the stream channel; (ii) soil moisture (or even groundwater) from unsampled parts of the catchment, where either less weathering has occurred or the weathering zone is closer to the surface (e.g. due to tectonic activity).

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', '[10] M8 has been the site of ongoing hillslope research by several research teams since the late 1970s. These studies have facilitated the development of a very detailed yet qualitative perceptual model of hillslope hydrology, reviewed recently by McGlynn et al. [2002]. While dye tracer studies by Mosley [1979] showed that storm rainfall follows preferential flow pathways at the hillslope scale, subsequent water isotopic tracing studies in the catchment by Pearce et al. [1986] and Sklash et al. [1986] showed (paradoxically) that there was little if any event water in the stream during storm flow periods. Thus stored soil water and groundwater comprise the majority of channel storm flow. McDonnell [1990] developed a perceptual model to explain the mechanism of storm flow generation by constraining the dominant processes using recording tensiometer observations, isotope tracing and various other chemical and hydrometric approaches. For small events of less than about 15 mm rainfall, McDonnell et al. [1991] found that the riparian zone (i.e., the near-stream valley bottom) could account for the volume of old water in the channel hydrograph. During larger events, McDonnell [1990] found that hillslope hollows (i.e., topographic convergent zones on the slopes) were the dominant runoff producing zones where new water moved to depth and created a perched water table at the soil-bedrock interface. Lateral pipe flow then formed along the soil bedrock interface [McDonnell et al., 1998], conveying quantities of old water laterally downslope sufficient in quantity and quality to explain measured old water volumes. Topographic convergence of flow paths from planar hillslopes to the hollows enabled hollows to be well primed for rapid conversion of matrix to pressure potentials. Soil water isotopic composition [McDonnell et al., 1991] and chemical composition (E. Grady and H. Elsenbeer, personal communication, 2000) all followed a similar pattern of distinct and unambiguous response zones and inter-storm reservoirs: hillslopes, hollows and riparian zones. These zones display very different groundwater dynamics [McDonnell, 1990] and group clearly, based on their isotopic characteristics. Data of McDonnell et al. [1991], although not fully appreciated at the time of publication, revealed, using a cluster analysis, the three distinct isotopic groupings from suction lysimeter data extracted from 11 devices across the catchment. Finally, according to the perceptual model of McDonnell et al. [1991] flow occurs from the hillslope zone to the hollow zone and from there to the riparian zone before contributing to runoff. The soil catena sequences observed in the catchment by McKie [1978] confirm this perception based on soil characteristics.', '2.2', '3', 'Perceptual Model of the Maimai Watershed', 3, '1', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'Slopes described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 265, 137, 265, 2, 6, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'During event 1 (Figure 4a), the first 20 minutes (from 1510 to 1530 hours) showed a higher rainfall intensity than the measured soil hydraulic conductivity (and most likely infiltration rate). At the same time, subsurface sensors showed the water table to be below the surface at locations 4, 6, 16 and 26. This suggests that surface runoff during that period was most likely due to the IE mechanism (Table IIIa, b, c and d). The subsurface sensor at location 6 having high soil hydraulic conductivity showed an increase in perched water table. This suggests that at location 6, a restrictive layer exists on which a perched water table builds up when the rainfall amount and intensity is high enough. Location 16 also shows features of the presence of a restrictive layer near the surface. From 1530 to 1550 hours, although the rainfall intensity decreased, locations 4, 6, 16 and 26 continued to show runoff, which was attributed to residual runoff from the high intensity rainfall period. Similar results were observed for event 2. The time period from 1620 to 1700 hours was selected to show the type of runoff generation mechanism that occurred during this storm (Table IVa, b, c and d). Analysis of the data shows that the rainfall intensity was of the order of the measured soil hydraulic conductivities at location4 and 16. Locations 4, 16 and 26 showed IE runoff during this period. Location 16 showed no runoff from1620 to 1630 hours. The same location showed IE runoff from 1640 to 1700 hours (Table IVc). The subsurface sensor, however, showed an increase in perched water table at this location. This could possibly be due to the restrictive layer near the surface as discussed earlier. Considering that the rainfall intensity during this event was not orders of magnitude higher than the soil hydraulic conductivity estimated for this site, it is not surprising that no runoff was initially observed at this location16. Location 6, which had a much higher hydraulic conductivity compared with the rainfall intensities for this event, showed no runoff. Furthermore, since this location also appears to have a restrictive layer near the surface, a perched water table builds up at this location as well. However, because of the medium rainfall intensity during this event, the water table did not reach the soil surface. For event 3, the time period from 0330 to 0350 hours was selected for discussion (Figure 4c). This period is the initial part of the long duration storm that lasted for 19 h35 min. During this period, rainfall intensity was much lower than the saturated hydraulic conductivity at most of the locations within the field. During this event location 4and 26 showed runoff for the initial 10 – 15 min, followed by no runoff (Table Va, d). This was attributed to the initial existence of hydrophobicity of the soil. Location 6(Table Vb), which had a high soil hydraulic conductivity, did not show any runoff during this event.

D&B illustrated the functioning of the VSA concept as it relates to landscapes that have extensive areas with a hydrogeological/topographic limit to the conveyance capacity of the shallow subsurface. When and where that limit was exceeded, return flow/exfiltration occurred and was augmented by rainfall and/or snowmelt as SOF. [...] Like the Scandinavian catchments of Water''s Way (Grip and Rodhe, 1985, 1994), hydrology at the SRRW is profoundly influenced by the glacial deposits that mantle the landscape. In particular, the dense silty basal till provides high storage capacity in a low-permeability material, which sustains baseflow. However, spatial heterogeneity in slope, soil drainage class and presence of a fragipan gives rise to contrasting hydrograph recession characteristics even in adjacent catchments at the SRRW (Comer and Zimmermann, 1969; Engman, 1981). Relative to the Scandinavian catchments of Water''s Way, the SRRW has more rugged topography; thus, steeper hydraulic gradients are a greater consideration in water delivery from hillslope to stream. Another important factor in the hydrology is the jointing and fracturing, which form primary controls on drainage patterns (Newell, 1970) and spring locations (Dunne, 1980). The glacial advances scoured and re-deposited material in patterns determined by the direction of ice flow over the pre-existing topography (Newell, 1970). The post-glacial hydrology likely reflects only minor adjustments from pre-glacial drainage patterns, but major shifts in storage capacity, permeability and hydrologic flow paths. [...] At the SRRW, mixing of return flow and direct precipitation to generate SOF provides an explanation for variation in stream chemistry and new water and solute inputs while old water dominates stormflow.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'For instance, at Coweeta, due to high infiltration rates and large storage capacities, soil moisture is believed to contribute substantially to subsurface storage that sustains streams throughout the year (Gaskin et al., 1989; Hewlett, 1961, Hewlett & Hibbert, 1967). Our findings show that for nearly 40% of storms, soil moisture peaked prior to runoff (Figure 8 and Table S4) indicating potential subsurface contributions from hillslopes to runoff at the catchment outlet. Similar results have been noted in other headwaters where subsurface flows from riparian zones influence streamflow (McGlynn & McDonnell, 2003; Penna et al., 2011). Past work at Coweeta implicates shallow groundwater from NS areas as a major contributor to streamflow responses to storms (Hewlett & Hibbert, 1967; Singh et al., 2018). The results from this study suggest that unsaturated flow from NS areas of hillslopes may also contribute to streamflow generation. Our findings are further supported by recent work demonstrating the coupling of unsaturated flow and shallow groundwater at Coweeta, and the relationship of both fluxes to streamflow at the catchment outlet (Scaife et al., 2020). Storm properties appear to mediate relationships between soil moisture and runoff responses at Coweeta (Figure 8). Storm depth partly explained this relationship, and a possible mechanism could be enhanced hydrologic connectivity and greater subsurface flows from hillslopes to streams during larger storms (e.g., McGlynn & McDonnell, 2003; Penna et al., 2011; Scaife et al., 2020). Mean storm intensity also appears to mediate lags between soil moisture and runoff responses, likely because the rapid propagation of wetting fronts resulted in a shorter lag between soil moisture and runoff. Overall, these results emphasize the influence of storm properties on the soil moisture-runoff relationship at event scales. [...] In contrast, we did not detect any significant effect (p > 0.05) of preferential flow on soil moisture-runoff relationships, indicating the insensitivity of variable preferential flows along hillslopes to soil moisture-runoff relationships.

Basin-wide trace experiments using environmental isotopes (18O, deuterium, tritium) and hydrometric studies carried out in hydrogeologically diverse watersheds, indicate that for all except the most intense rain storms and the most prolific melting days, groundwater dominates the runoff hydrographs in the study basins. The increased groundwater discharge during runoff events is apparently related to a rapid rise in hydraulic head along the perimeter of transient and perennial discharge areas. This groundwater ridging phenomenon probably arises from the almost instantaneous conversion of the near-surface tension-saturated capillary fringe into phreatic water. The ridging precedes, and is apparently independent of the response of the rest of the basin. In addition to its compatibility with several of the field observations commonly associated with contemporary concepts of runoff generation, the groundwater discharge theory explains some of the temporal variations in stream water chemistry which are not adequately accounted for by other theories.', 'N/A', '45', 'Abstract', 2, '2', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 269, 193, 269, 3, 13, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Despite the preliminary nature of the groundwater and residence time estimates, it seems clear that within the Feshie both flow path partitioning and mean residence time are both strongly influenced by soil cover and distribution. In particular, the relative importance of ‘responsive’ soils and ‘recharge’ soils appear to be of critical importance. ‘Responsive’ soils are those that promote rapid hydrological responses in stream runoff to precipitation and/or snowmelt via overland flow or shallow subsurface storm flow. These are mainly peats, shallow alpine soils and areas of exposed bedrock, and interestingly detailed process studies in the area (Wheater et al., 1991, Wheater et al., 1993, Davies et al., 1993, Jenkins et al., 1994, Soulsby et al., 2000) largely corroborate the flow path interpretation given by HOST. Similarly, ‘recharge’ soils are those dominated by slower vertical drainage to the soil/bedrock interface or water table, such as humus iron podzols, deeper sub-alpine soils and alluvial soils, again this is consistent with insights from other process studies in the catchment (Soulsby et al., 1998, Soulsby et al., 1999). Although a large mountainous catchment like the Feshie is complex and this interpretation greatly simplifies the process complexity and heterogeneity at the hillslope scale, such basic flow path understanding facilitates a conceptualisation of catchment functioning which is consistent with the patterns of runoff response observed (e.g. Fig. 3), the hydrograph separations (Table 3) and the mean residence time estimates (Table 4a, Table 4b). Stated simply, the cover of peats and shallow alpine soils/bedrock in catchments like the upper Feshie and the Eidart facilitates rapid storm runoff from saturation overland flow and shallow sub-surface storm flow. This accordingly reduces groundwater recharge and results in low mean residence times. Conversely, more freely draining soils, such as iron podzols and deeper sub-alpine soils in sub-catchments like the Chomraig and Allt a'' Mharcaidh, contribute to greater groundwater recharge, a more subdued storm period response from deeper subsurface storm flow, higher groundwater contributions and longer mean residence times.', '4.5', '214', 'Conceptual model of catchment response', 2, '1', 'N', 'Multiple properties described', 'N', 'Topography described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 270, 67, 270, 6, 2, 2),

These characteristicsexert strong controls on catchment hydrological pathways (Figure 1). At altitudes above 800 m, freely drainingalpine soils overlie extensive periglacial deposits. Theseare characterized by vertical flow paths to the bedrockinterface, and water subsequently discharges at high-altitude springs, or flows laterally down slope in the deepersubsurface (Wheateret al., 1991). In this down-slope area, hillsides steepen and podzolic soils predominate.These are characterized by transient lateral flow paths (subsurface stormflow) in the more permeable organicsurface  horizon  during  storm  events,  and,  during  largestorms,  for  prolonged  periods  after  storms  in  thedeeper subsurface in the  soil mineral horizons (Wheateret al., 1993).

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'From the soil physical characteristics and the tensiometer data, a conceptual model of the hydrological storm response of the stagnopodzol hillslope can be developed. The penetration of the E horizon and ironpan by coarse tree roots creates macropores which facilitate vertical drainage. Water therefore moves vertically through the profile into the underlying drift and at approximately 1.0-1.2 m reaches the impermeable bedrock, where it is deflected downslope towards the drainage ditch. Although no hydraulic conductivity measurements were possible, the drift immediately above the bedrock was unconsolidated and appeared to be highly permeable, so that deep throughflow would be relatively rapid. In wet periods the B and C horizon tensiometers at set A were consistently wetter than their upslope counterparts. This is particularly noticeable during February and March, when the C horizon was saturated in major storm events (Fig. 2). The probable explanation is that downslope water movement above the bedrock produces a saturated wedge that extends higher into the soil profile and backs upslope. During such wet periods, throughflow will contribute to runoff in the drainage ditch. However, because of the freely draining nature of the C horizon and underlying drift, saturation is transient and the saturated zone contracts rapidly after storm events. During the winter period, flows in the ditch draining the subcatchment responded within 1-4 h of rainfall commencing and peaked within 1-3 h of the peak rainfall intensity (Soulsby, 1991). Given the long, relatively slow pathway through the stagnopodzol profile, a major part of the ditch response must be generated from the peat in the upper part of the subcatchment (Fig. 4). Peats in upland Wales saturate rapidly in storm events, and saturation overland flow can make a major contribution to the storm hydrograph (Newson, 1981). Moreover, the ploughing and ditching of peat allows overland flow to be routed rapidly and directly along plough furrows into drainage ditches (David and Ledger, 1988). Between winter events, base flows were sustained even when overland flow from the peat was observed to have ceased; this implies slower drainage from the stagnopodzols. As a result of the freely draining nature of the drifts, seepage was not sustained during prolonged dry periods so that flows in the ditch were ephemeral (Fig. 4). The water balance shows that the subcatchment is not watertight (Table 3). Only 915 mm of incident precipitation was measured as runoff at the sub-catchment weir. Transpiration losses were estimated from water balance calculations for a watertight gley subcatchment (Fig. 1); it is reasonable to assume that these will be similar in the podzol-peat subcatchment, indicating that runoff is 439 mm lower than expected. The most probable explanation for this is that the permeable drift material which forms the base of drainage ditches dug into the stagnopodzols allows the seepage of water under a suitable hydraulic gradient. In addition, some losses may occur through percolation and deep seepage above the bedrock, though the topography and impermeable geology of the subcatchment dictates that such losses are probably small. Thus, almost 30% of effective precipitation leaves the subcatchment as seepage, mainly through the bed of the ditch. As most storm runoff is generated from the peat soils of the subcatchment, it appears that seepage occurs as water is transferred along ditches cut into the stagnopodzols. This explains why flows in the ditch reached the weir on only three occasions between May and September (Fig. 4), despite some substantial rainfall inputs (Fig. 2). Field observations during several summer storms showed that although runoff was generated by overland flow on the subcatchment peat, seepage into the bed of the ditch prevented this from reaching the weir.\n', 'N/A', '435', 'Catchment hydrology', 2, '3', 'Wetland described', 'Soil types described', 'Geological types described', 'Slopes described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 272, 125, 272, 2, 1, 2),

The extent of saturation in the riparian wetland expands and contracts in response to antecedent wetness and event precipitation [similar to Dunne et al., 1975]. In wet periods, the saturation zone was observed to extend to 40% of the catchment area and the connectivity between the hillslopes and wetland is strong as a result of lateral flow [Ali et al., 2014]. This drives the main storm period response of the catchment, with runoff being generated by saturation overland flow from this expanding saturation zone which is fed by seepage from upslope [Tetzlaff et al., 2014]. In drier periods, the saturation zone can be as low as 2% of the catchment and the hillslopes can become disconnected. At these times, streamflow is sustained mainly from groundwater in the drift [Soulsby et al., 1998; Blumstock et al., 2015].

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Within this model, the three major subdivisions of land cover in this landscape are considered: exposed Precambrian bedrock, soil-filled areas covered with wetland or forest vegetation underlain by permafrost, and open water in ponds, lakes, and connecting streams. The spring freshet is a predominant feature of this hydrological regime (Figure 10a). During this time, contributing areas can be large with significant portions of the basin hydrologically connected to the outlet. This can be dampened when dry conditions during the previous freezeup leave large storage deficits relative to snowmelt inputs in soil-filled areas and lakes. Runoff from exposed bedrock carries solutes into downslope soil filled areas where it is augmented by local runoff generation and additional solute load. The frost table at this time of year is shallow, so runoff pathways tend to be in shallow soil depths where DOC can be transported downslope. Inorganic nitrogen sources are available because most vegetation is dormant until after the freshet when the soils thaw and the growing season begins. The remainder of the summer is typically characterized by evapotranspiration rates that exceed rainfall, such that the water table elevation drops in concert with the frost table, and large storage deficits develop in lakes and soil-filled components of the landscape (Figure 10b). Runoff from exposed bedrock carrying solutes is intercepted in the soil-filled areas and goes into storage. During the typically dry summer conditions, soil-filled areas are hydrologically disconnected from the stream and do not contribute runoff, suppressing chemical transport (e.g., late summer 2012/2013). There can be some subsurface transport of water, solids, and carbon, but inorganic nitrogen tends to be efficiently used by the vegetation with little left for transport downstream. Lake levels decline from the low headwater runoff, reducing streamflow. [...] However, when autumn rainfall is sufficient, lateral flows from bedrock can cause water tables to rise and overcome storage deficits in soil-filled areas. The interaction of subsurface flow with deeper mineral soils at the base of the thick active layer may increase solute loads. Saturation of soils also maintains the water table near the topographic surface so that the majority of water flux is through high hydraulic conductivity zones of organic-rich soils, which augments the carbon flux. Inorganic nitrogen loading begins to increase in the fall as vegetation goes into senescence. During a typical recession, the conditions illustrated in Figure 10b likely continue right into the period when freezeback begins. A comparison of Figures 10b–10d highlights the differences the model suggests exist in water, carbon, solute, and nitrogen fluxes that occur during a period of enhanced winter streamflow. By midwinter during the periods of enhanced winter streamflow, the freezeback of soils has been completed, isolating most terrestrial areas from the lake-stream network. High autumn rainfall-runoff results in a high level of storage in the lakes and an ample volume of water available to provide steady streamflow through the winter.

Even the fragipan soils near the stream, which have only limited moisture holding capacity and root penetration as a result of the confining layer, remain relatively moist because of this frequent rainfall and their proximity to the high water table. Soil moisture is generally variable only to about the 100cm depth[Gburek, 1977]. Below this depth soil moisture content remains nearly constant at near field capacity throughout the year. Based on measurements from more than 30 groundwater wells, Urban [1977] constructed a water table map for WE-38. The groundwater profile is highly correlated with topography. Because of the relatively high moisture content of the soils the actual evapotranspiration (ET) is at or  near its potential rate much of the time.

Water continuously flows from the soil layer just above the weir (Figures 1 and 2), and this point is referred to as the “spring.” The surface outlets of some natural soil pipes were seen along the longitudinal axis of the hollow (Figures 1 and 2). [...] [10] Previous hydrological studies of Toinotani zero-order valley have demonstrated the importance of pipe flow in runoff generation [Mizuyama, 1994; Uchida et al., 1999]. Mizuyama [1994] observed that during a heavy rain (total rainfall was 70 mm; peak rainfall intensity was 18 mm h−1), water flowed from the spring, pipe A, and pipe group B (Figure 2). Hortonian overland flow did not occur in Toinotani as a result of the high saturated hydraulic conductivity of the surface soil. Even in this heavy storm event, the groundwater table did not intersect the soil surface, and saturation overland flow was seldom observed [Mizuyama, 1994]. However, pipe flow discharge resulted in surface flow in between the outlet of pipe A and the spring (Figure 2). A recent study called the overland flow from soil pipes “pipe overland flow” [Putty and Prasad, 2000]. At Toinotani both subsurface storm flow and pipe overland flow have been shown to be dominant sources of storm runoff generation (Figure 2).\n[11] Measurements of 102 storms showed that the storm runoff could be classified into three stages. In the first stage, water discharge occurs only from the spring. As the rainfall intensity and the cumulative rainfall increase, water comes out of pipe A (Figure 2). Under the heaviest rainfall, additional discharge occurs from pipe group B (the third stage). A combination of the antecedent precipitation index and the peak rainfall intensity is useful to predict the presence of ephemeral flow from pipe A and pipe group B [Uchida et al., 1999]. [...] Lateral water movement could be classified into two categories based on the rainfall magnitude. When the total rainfall was less than ∼30 mm, the runoff process could be explained by Darcy''s law using the saturated hydraulic conductivity obtained from soil cores. When the total rainfall amount was greater than ∼30 mm, streamflow immediately increased after the occurrence of pipe flow, even though the pore water pressure at the near-spring well was stable. Moreover, when pipe flow occurred, the estimated effective hydraulic conductivity was 1–2 orders of magnitude greater than the measured saturated hydraulic conductivity. Results of both the thermal response and recession hydrograph indicated that when pipe flow was >0.008 mm h−1 (0.013 L s−1), the source of streamflow was the same as pipe flow. In other words, the transient groundwater was delivered from the area upslope of the soil pipe outlet to the stream via soil pipes, shortcutting the normal mixing with the groundwater near the spring.\n[45] When the antecedent condition was relatively dry (API10 was <7 mm), the transient groundwater was dominated by preevent soil water. In contrast, after a storm with >70 mm of rainfall and wet antecedent condition, water emerging from the bedrock contributed to the formation of transient saturated groundwater. Furthermore, despite the dry antecedent condition, after a heavy rainfall with >190 mm the bedrock groundwater was an important contributor to the transient groundwater in the upslope area. When water emerging from the bedrock contributed to the formation of the transient groundwater, the bedrock groundwater was delivered to the stream via soil pipes, shortcutting the normal mixing process through the soil matrix. Consequently, after a heavy downpour the contribution of bedrock groundwater to the falling limb of both streamflow and pipe flow were considerable.', '2, 6', '2', 'Study Site, Summary and Conclusions', 1, '3', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 276, 232, 276, 1, 6, 2),

(ii) Slow base flow components (deep groundwater) originate from the fractured hard rock aquifer and the deeper parts of the weathering zone (mean residence time of the water: six to nine years; determined by 3H-measurements). (iii) An intermediate flow system contributes mainly from the (peri-)glacial deposits of the slopes (shallow groundwater). Here soil water displacement takes place and perched groundwater tables can spread above less conductive layers. In addition, macropore flow occurs locally (for process description see e.g. Bonell, 1998). This results mainly in delayed runoff components which can also contribute to flood formation depending on the antecedent moisture content (mean residence time of the water: two to three years; determined by ~SO- measurements).

Together with further field observations the experimental results led to the development of the following conceptual model of runoff generation. Three main flow systems were identified (Figure 2). (i) Fast runoff components (near-surface runoff) are generated on sealed or saturated areas; both are real surface runoff components. In addition, fast runoff components are generated on steep highly permeable slopes covered by boulder trains. At this source area, very fast subsurface storm flow components are formed in this highly permeable material, which is situated above almost impermeable bedrock. The mean residence time of the near-surface runoff components is in the order of hours to a few days, which was shown by artificial tracer tests (Mehlhornet al., 1998) and hydrograph separations during events (Uhlenbrook, 1999; Hoeget al., 2000). (ii) Slow base flow components (deep groundwater) originate from the fractured hard rock aquifer and the deeper parts of the weathering zone. The mean residence time of the water amounts to 6 to 9 years, determined by tritium and CFC measurements (Uhlenbrook, 1999; Uhlenbrook et al., 2000). There is no evidence that these components are important for flood formation. (iii) An intermediate flow system contributes mainly from the (peri-)glacial deposits of the slopes (shallow groundwater). Here, soil water displacement takes place or perched groundwater tables can spread above less conductive layers. Also, the transmissivity feedback mechanism (see Bishop, 1991) is dominant in some areas, where the hydraulic conductivity decreases significantly with depth and lateral flow is more important if the water tables rise. In addition, macropore flow occurs locally [e.g. for process description see Bonell (1998)]. This results mainly in a delayed runoff component, which can also contribute to flood formation depending on the antecedent moisture content. The mean residence time of the water is 2to 3 years, determined by oxygen-18 measurements (Uhlenbrook, 1999; Uhlenbrook et al., 2000). However, these relatively long residence times may mask the importance of this source area for flood formation. A high runoff dynamic was shown for springs draining such hillslopes. The contributions of near-surface runoff, the shallow groundwater and deep groundwater for a period of3 years in the Brugga were calculated according to measurements of oxygen-18 and tritium to be 11Ð1%,69Ð4% and 19Ð5% respectively (Uhlenbrook et al., 2000). Even if a relatively large uncertainty has to be assumed for these numbers, this demonstrates clearly the dominance of the shallow groundwater system and, consequently, the importance of the slopes for the runoff generation in the test site. For short periods during events the near-surface runoff components may amount to more than 50%. This was shown by hydrograph separations for different events using hourly time steps in the Brugga and Zastler basins (Uhlenbrook, 1999; Hoeget al., 2000). [...] The following unit types with the associated dominant runoff generation mechanisms are distinguished (Figure 3).\n(a) The runoff from saturated areas is classified as saturation overland flow (G ̈untner et al., 1999b).\n(b) Sealed areas generate Horton overland flow.\n(c) Flow through moraine material is slow due to the consolidated matrix, independent of slope (Lindenlaub, 1998). Thus, base flow formation is considered.\n(d) Boulder trains (average slope: 31Ð8°) generate fast macropore flow, even in times of low antecedent moisture content (Mehlhorn, 1999). Fast near-surface macropore flow is considered for these areas.\n(e) For flat areas (<10°) located in the valley floors close to the channel network, groundwater ridging is assumed [e.g. for process description see Sklash and Farvolden (1979)].\n(f) On hilltop areas and hilly uplands with minor slope (<15°), water percolates to the deeper parts of the weathering zone and the fractured bedrock and runs off slowly, contributing to base flow (Uhlenbrook et al., 2000).\n(g) Steeper hillslopes (>10° at the base and >15° at the hilltop; average: 21Ð8°) are covered with a stratified drift cover, which causes mainly delayed matrix flow.

During the peak flows, a rapid infiltration of an important part of rain via preferential pathways (e.g. macropores) could explain the sharp rising of the water table, the variation of the isotopic signature and the decrease of silica content in the superficial layers. This groundwater ridging causes an increasing extent of the saturated area which could induce superficial runoff due to groundwater exfiltration.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'In ephemeral watersheds, a large storage capacity typically exists, in particular during extended, dry summer periods. In order to exceed this capacity, the antecedent conditions must be moist to allow for runoff generation in permeable soils and arroyos [Castillo et al., 2003; Howes and Abrahams, 2003]. It is evident from the rainfall and discharge observations that prior storms led to high antecedent wetness which primed the basin for a vigorous flood response. The runoff ratio computed at two locations indicates that the majority of the rainfall was absorbed in the basin, with a decreasing ratio as catchment area increased. While this has been seen in small basins of the southwestern United States [Goodrich et al., 1997], evidence has not existed at large spatial scales. In ephemeral tributaries, a propagating flood may be generated from the synchronized contributions of inner basins, but must still overcome channel losses to reach the watershed outlet. Flood characteristics, including the peak amount, wave velocity and recession rate, depend upon interactions with the channel bed and vegetated floodplain [Gorbach et al., 1996; Molnár and Ramírez, 2001]. Given these interactions, the rainfall-runoff transformation can be highly complex and nonlinear in ephemeral watersheds, in particular if landscape changes are occurring in the basin. Furthermore, surface-groundwater interactions along the internal tributary reaches and in the downstream river eventually lead to significant losses in flood volume due to focused recharge of the underlying aquifer.\n[37] The third part of the conceptual model involves the interaction of a propagating flood wave with the shallow aquifer along a losing reach. The dynamics of the flood-induced changes in the water table level are highly transient but spatially coherent. Various factors control the variations in the aquifer response including the diminishing flood stage along the reach, the spatial heterogeneity in the aquifer materials and the effects of localized hydraulic gradients. The aquifer response typically diminishes along the reach and across the floodplain, but remain fairly similar over the sampled depth. On the basis of the observed three-dimensional propagation of the groundwater response from multiple wells, it is evident that kinematic propagation occurs in the saturated aquifer. As a result, wave travel velocities far exceed predictions of Darcian flow across the full floodplain width. While this has been documented in humid settings [Jung et al., 2004], evidence for this mechanism has not been observed in the semiarid southwestern United States. Furthermore, well behavior suggests that the response propagates more quickly through the deeper portions of the aquifer due to semiconfining layers which retard responses at the shallower wells.', '5', '9', 'Discussion', 2, '1', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 284, 187, 284, 2, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'A very systematical and robust pattern of subsurface runoff accounting for total water yield among frozen ground categories could be indicated: as the permafrost extent declined, GRD/WY ratios progressively increased, once the permafrost thawed completely which turned into seasonally frozen ground, the proportion of subsurface runoff in catchment total runoff would still remain at a higher level (Fig. 7c). And these observed hydrological features appeared to be the reflective of thawing of permafrost and were presumably associated to its degree of degrading influence, as previous studies proposed that a general trajectory of progressive permafrost degradation occurred in SAYR was: CP–EDP–PDP–SDP–SFG [19]. Furthermore, preliminary observations demonstrated that the dynamic behaviors of groundwater system, including recharge, flow pathway, and discharge were sensitive to the changes in permafrost conditions [13].\nIn regions where extensive occurrence of thick and cold permafrost served as a relatively stable regional aquitard, subsurface flow paths and recharge and discharge conditions were limited by permafrost at various degrees [13]. The runoff characteristics and volumes were mainly dependent on the atmospheric precipitation and surface waters suggested by the relative-low tritium concentrations, while shallow groundwater contributed limited portion in discharges at watershed outlets (< 40%), which leading to low water yields in catchment scale (take CP watersheds as example) [30].\nWhen shallow permafrost began to thaw, reginal water yields were found to yield up to several hundred millimetres exceeding precipitation runoff ratios were over 1, which indicating additional runoff from permafrost meltwater [31]. Unlike previous observations in northern Alberta (Canada) where early thawing of extensive permafrost was less effective at producing runoffs, statistically higher tritium concentrations, water yields, groundwater discharges, and runoff ratios were found in EDP regions [32]. These evidences suggested that intensive and rapid permafrost thaw was lasting, which led to increase moisture availability and release additional meltwater, further confirmed by the short-term enhancing runoff ratios (Fig. 7d) [11]. However, the contributions to water yields were being limited to meltwater in deepening active layer, as the groundwater proportions did not increase significantly (Fig. 7c). As thawing progresses continued which induced substantial disappearance of permafrost, antecedent ice content would decline to cause the decrease in water yields [32].\nAdditionally, the enhanced recharges below active layer, improvement of subsurface hydraulic connectivity, reactivating and alteration of subsurface runoff pathways, and new formation of taliks proposed by previous researches were consistent with the hydrological simulations taking in PDP and SDP regions, all of which would reshape the groundwater flow behaviors [9, 13, 17, 19]. It can be inferred from the apparent decline in runoff ratios, during the transition from EDP to PDP, the enlargement of groundwater storage appeared to buffer surface and subsurface runoff generation processes where both of surface and subsurface water could drain to subsurface aquifers [13, 33].\nWhile in the landscape conversion form PDP to SDP, the substantial growth in subsurface flow fluxes which accounted for over half of total runoff seemed to be the primary controlling factor to raise up the water yields, although the increase was not statistically significant due to ceased meltwater (Fig. 7a). Similar results were also found in the lower Liard River valley, where runoff produced from subsurface pathways was a secondary contributor in the increase stream flows [33]. At this stage, large expanse of stable aquitard was absent, greater fluctuations in hydrological responses were driven by diverse factors, mainly including climatic and land cover drivers, such as logicalized topography and geomorphology, ground ice contents and complex hydraulic connectivity [34].\nAlthough water yields and runoff ratios in SFG region were comparable with that in CP region, the groundwater proportions in SFG region were twice times more than that in CP region. As permafrost (ground ice) had been completely exhausted, groundwater storage reservoirs became the most important supply source to maintain regional runoff availability [35]. The short-term decrease trend in runoff ratios indicated an eventual feature of decline in runoff generation appeared to dominate the hydrological pattern in predominantly post thaw systems [32].', 'N/A', '251', 'Hydrological evolution of surface and subsurface flows', 1, '1', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 285, 205, 285, 1, 2, 2),

Its depression area has water holding capacity, and the layer contains various water leakage structures (e.g., fissures, conduits, and sinkholes). The bottom layer is the bedrock layer and is unweathered. SR occurs at the soil surface (Fig. 7: SR), SSR occurs at the SEI (Fig. 7: SSR), and ESR occurs at the EBI (Fig. 7: ESR). Because the hydraulic conductivity of soil (26–255 mm ) is higher than that of the epikarst (, 30–50 mm ), rainfall rapidly infiltrates and reaches the SEI, accumulates in the depression area of the SEI, until instantaneous water tables at the depression area reach the edge of the depression (filling process) (Fig. 7c: Infiltrating and filling).

A hydraulic pressure increase of only a few millimetres can lead to a relatively large amount of discharge because of the large area of impact and topographic convergence (Bergmann et al., 1996).

As is typical of semiarid environments, runoff at our site was ephemeral and occurred only as a result of ''extreme'' precipitation events (such as greater-than- average snowfall, very intense rainfall, or unusually prolonged frontal storms). The nature of these events, along with the physical properties of the soil, determined what form the runoff took. For example, lateral subsurface flow was important at our site because the combination of occasional very wet conditions and the presence of a shallow restrictive horizon allowed a shallow zone of saturation to develop, while a network of macropores facilitated this type of flow. Macropores also facilitated small amounts of flow when the soils were unsaturated. Surface runoff was also important and occurred in the form of IEOF. During the winter, this type of runoff was facilitated by frozen soils. During other periods, it was generated by intense thunderstorms or prolonged frontal storms. At the hillslope scale, frozen soil runoff was strongly affected by degree of shading and location of snowdrifts, whereas rainfall-generated runoff was affected more by extent of vegetation cover (considerably more surface runoff of this type was generated from the south hillslope, which had more exposed bare ground, than from the north hillslope)', '6', '2311', 'Conclusions', 1, '2', 'Forest described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 290, 129, 290, 1, 1, 2),

Due to an abrupt change in saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) between the organic (38.9 m d−1) and the near-surface mineral layer (0.15 m d−1), this organic horizon flow can contribute up to 78 % of the total discharge during storm events (Fleischbein et al., 2006; Goller et al., 2005). However, the overall importance of this organic horizon flow is still disputable because the rainfall intensity rarely gets close to such a high saturated hydraulic conductivity. In 95 % of the measured rainfall events between June 2010 and October 2012 the intensity was below 0.1 m d−1 (≈ 4.1 mm h−1) and was therefore 15 times lower than the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the mineral soil layer below the organic layer under forest vegetation and around 30 times lower than the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the top soil under pasture vegetation (Zimmermann and Elsenbeer, 2008; Crespo et al., 2012). The same conclusion holds true for the occurrence of surface runoff due to infiltration access on pasture (lacking a significant organic layer). Solely based on rainfall intensities, surface runoff is therefore relatively unlikely to contribute to a larger extent in rainfall–runoff generation. The reported Ksat values are based on measurements of 250 cm3 undisturbed soil core samples vertically extracted from the center of each respective layer. Due to the chosen sampling method and the limited size of the soil cores, the effective saturated hydraulic conductivity will be even higher and can vary for the horizontal flow component. When and to which extent a subsurface saturated prior to the rainfall event would still trigger surface runoff on pastures therefore remains to be investigated. Bücker et al. (2010) and Timbe et al. (2014) were able to show that base flow, on the other hand, has a rather large influence on the annual discharge volume across different land use types, accounting for > 70 and > 85 %, respectively. These findings are also supported by the long MTT of the base flow for different sub-catchments of the Rio San Francisco in comparison to the fast runoff reaction times, varying according to Timbe et al. (2014) between 2.1 and 3.9 years. Accordingly, the current findings confirm that the base flow – originating from deeper mineral soil and bedrock layers–is dominating the overall hydrological system in the study area (Crespo et al., 2012; Goller et al., 2005).

The results of the two-component mixing model verified that middle-slope shallow subsurface flow was the major flow pathway contributing to the stream water. As shown in Figure 3b, there was a large amount of water storage in the thawed soil layers above the underlying impermeable freezing front. The shallower thawed soil layers of the hillslope with higher hydraulic conductivity played an important role as an intensive mixing zone and flow pathway, where precipitation mixed with soil water.\nThe position of stream water (Group I) was relatively far from the MSW of the riparian zone and the 80-cm depth of the middle slope (Group III, Figure 6). The enriched stable isotope signatures of the deeper soil layer and lower slope position (Group III, Figure 6) might be attributable to the following aspects. First, the stable isotope signatures of MSW became progressively enriched because of evaporation. Second, the old and enriched soil water was displaced and pushed to deeper soil layers by newly infiltrated rainfall. Third, with the movement of lateral subsurface flow, a large amount of enriched water converged to and was stored in the riparian zone due to its lower and flatter terrain. These results may indicate that each soil layer of the riparian zone and the deeper soil layers of the hillslope were not direct contributors to streamflow but rather promoters of hillslope runoff generation. A conceptual diagram of current runoff generation processes in the permafrost influenced alpine meadow hillslope was shown in Figure 9a. With the high wetness and low conductivity of the riparian zone and the deeper soil layers (30–60 cm) of the middle slope, new water and old water were mixed in the shallower layers above the saturated soil layer of the hillslope and formed the shallow subsurface flow, which became surface runoff at the riparian zone, and then contributed to streamflow with relatively higher water flow velocity than the shallow subsurface flow.', '4.1', '1110', 'Main flow pathway of permafrost influenced alpine meadow hillslope', 3, '1', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 292, 267, 292, 2, 2, 2),

Surface soils are typically highly permeable sands and gravels and permit infiltration of almost all throughfall. Consequently, forested catchments experience negligible surface runoff of the infiltration-excess (Hortonian) type. The clayey B horizon is less permeable and gives rise to substantial subsurface runoff at the interface between the A and B horizons and to the development of a seasonal perched water table in the valley bottoms. This perched aquifer, in turn, provides a saturated source area where it intersects the surface and generates surface runoff by the saturation-excess (Dunne) mechanism. Williamson et al. [1987] estimated that surface runoff accounts for 4% of annual streamflow at Salmon, with subsurface throughflow contributing about 90% and groundwater discharge about 6%. However, groundwater discharge is expected to be considerably less in lower rainfall regions. Groundwater recharge at Salmon has been estimated as 2.2% of annual rainfall [Johnston,1983] and can take place either by matrix flow or through preferred pathways such as deep root channels.

Fig. 12a showed the stormflow generation during the below-Tg phase when soil water movement was predominantly controlled by matrix flow in the form of immobile water (Fig. 8, 9a and d, 12a). The channel discharge is mostly formed by direct rainfall or the recharge of shallow groundwater at the adjacent hillslope. As the rainfall intensity increased, soil water movement was gradually controlled by both matrix flow and preferential flow pathways (Fig. 12b). The potential perched water and ‘Fill and Spill’ process (Fu et al., 2013, Tromp-van Meerveld and McDonnell, 2006b) at the bedrock depression of the bedrock-soil interface could efficiently increase the hydrological connectivity of stream-adjacent hillslope and runoff minimum contributing area (MCA), leading to significantly higher Qq values. Once above the Tr with high rainfall intensity (Fig. 12c), significantly higher values of MCA and Qq were found, readily triggering the huge flash flood disasters (Fig. 12c).

While isolated, compacted patches of the hillslope may experience Hortonian overland flow, downslope area of higher Ks can possibly infiltrate it. An important consideration is therefore the continuity and connectiveness of these overland flow source areas. Important in ZOB3 after logging was the interaction of compacted areas with skid trails and roads, which provide linked corridors that transported overland flow and sediment long distances—often directly to the stream (Sidle et al., 2004). Furthermore, the observed depth-related decline in Ks may be most important on the highly degraded hillslopes where the following have occurred: (1) some portion of the upper topsoil has been removed, effectively reducing the depth at which a perched water table would form; (2) deep rooted vegetation has been replaced with shallow-rooted plants, thereby diminishing the ability of event water to quickly reach the groundwater table; and (3) a high density of road cuts creates many opportunities for interception of subsurface flow (Fig. 4b). Importantly, the shallow, horizontally-aligned root systems of the Kelet-kendondong vegetation association facilitates the development of near-surface pipes that terminate at the road cutface (Noguchi et al., 1997a). It is through such pipes that event water often flows from the subsoil onto the road surface. Thus, interaction between the decline in subsurface Ks, presence of biogenic pipes, and a high-density of logging roads, augment the generation of overland on the road surface.

This was further highlighted in the headwater catchment groundwater wells in Event 2 (Figure 11). Impeding soil horizons due to shifts in permeability or saturated hydraulic conductivity with depth have been shown to drive the redistribution of water across hillslopes (Elsenbeer, 2001; Heller & Kleber, 2016; McDaniel et al., 2008). These impeding layers can direct rapid subsurface flow paths laterally, while slower vertical percolation through both the soil matrix and preferential pathways can allow a deeper groundwater system to develop simultaneously (Du et al., 2016). In this study, we observed that shallow flow paths dominated runoff dynamics, suggesting an impeding layer strongly routed shallow flow laterally. We showed that stormflow-driven contributions, which were controlled by shallow flow paths, dominated the ASDN expansion in headwaters (Figure 5). Baseflow-associated ASDN expansion comprised a smaller component of drainage network dynamics in the headwaters. The seasonal rise and fall of the deep water table drove this baseflow-associated expansion and contraction during periods of intermittent runoff (Figure 5). As highlighted in the headwater catchment groundwater wells in Event 1 (Figure 11), groundwater levels were elevated prior to the event, which allowed for rapid activation of shallow flow paths during events. This dynamic allowed stormflow-driven ASDN expansion to still play a substantial role during periods of persistent baseflow contributions.\nThe composition of baseflow-associated versus stormflow-driven ASDN varied across the two watershed scales. The overall influence of baseflow-associated flow paths on network length increased with increasing watershed scale (Figure 5). However, even at the scale of the entire basin, stormflow-driven flow path contributions played an important role in runoff generation and ASDN expansion. The groundwater dynamics in wells located in the lowlands suggested a strong relationship between groundwater levels and runoff regardless of season (Figure 8c). High runoff at the entire basin outlet was dependent on high groundwater levels in the lowlands. However, it is in these landscape positions where the stratigraphy of the subsurface appeared to matter less for runoff generation because the continual rise of the deep water table disallowed any perching of a shallow water table to occur. We observed that lowland groundwater levels flattened out at lower runoff values and at a higher level than the shallow hillslope wells. However, the overall shape of the relationship between lowland groundwater levels and runoff at the entire basin outlet (Figure 8c) was generally similar to the relationship between the shallow, perched, transient water table and runoff in the headwater catchment (Figure 8a). This suggests similar influences of shallow groundwater on runoff across watershed scales. In both Event 1 and 2, lowland groundwater responded to precipitation inputs similarly to shallow groundwater in the headwaters (Figures 11 and 12).\nThe bedrock groundwater system exhibited strong seasonality that was related to the longitudinal expansion of the baseflow-associated ASDN. The groundwater level rise in the bedrock well was driven by recharge from precipitation, although the amount of percolation was influenced by evapotranspirative demands in the shallower subsurface environment (Figure 8d). When evapotranspiration was low and shallow soil water content was high, more percolation occurred, which raised the bedrock groundwater levels. When evapotranspiration was high, drainage of the aquifer outpaced vertical recharge. This recharge dynamic mirrored the deep groundwater well in the upper hillslope in the headwater catchment (Figure 8b), suggesting these groundwater systems were vertically connected or representative of the same deep groundwater system. Furthermore, groundwater in these two deep wells showed similar influences on runoff at both watershed scales. Event-driven runoff at the headwater catchment or the entire basin outlet was not related to groundwater dynamics in these deep zones (Figures 8b, 8d, and 11). However, these deep groundwater systems contributed to the spatial presence of baseflow, which was seen in Event 1 when the deep groundwater system was actively contributing to baseflow preevent (Figure 11).', '4.1.2', '1592', 'Vertically Partitioned Subsurface Flow Paths Drive Landscape Element Runoff Contributions and Drainage Network Dynamics', 2, '2', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 296, 58, 296, 3, 1, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Streamflow is intermittent and ceases usually in January due to low rainfall during the dry season (Fig. 3a) and the limited water storage capacity of LC. At the end of the dry season, the soils in LC show cracks up to 2 cm wide and 10 cm deep (Dietrich et al., 1982), due to the substantial admixture of smectite in the clay fraction (Grimm et al., 2008). The first rains saturate the soils quickly, cracks close and by July rainfall has increased the relative saturation in the upper soil to more than 60% (Fig. 3b). From that point onwards streamflow reacts extremely rapid to rainfall, which is reflected in a time to peak-value of 18 ± 10 min (mean ± 1 sd, n = 89 single peaked storm events, data from 2007 to 2009). An examination of soil physical properties in the study area reveals that we can safely rule out Horton-type overland flow because infiltrability values exceed rainfall intensities (infiltrability: 406.9 ± 157.5 mm h−1, median ± MAD (median absolute deviation), n = 18; maximum 5-min rainfall intensity: 16.8 ± 12.0 mm h−1, median ± MAD, n = 567 events, events are defined as rainfalls of at least 0.2 mm separated by a minimum dry period of 2 h). Soil permeability, however, decreases markedly at 20 cm depth (2.7 ± 2.6 mm h−1, median ± MAD, n = 14, Fig. 4), which results in an impeding layer, given the prevailing rainfall characteristics (Fig. 4) and soil moisture conditions during the wet season (Fig. 3b). The pronounced soil anisotropy in LC, expressed in the marked decrease of permeability with depth, explains previous (Godsey et al., 2004, Loos and Elsenbeer, 2011) and our observations (Figs. 2e and 5; see also Video 1, Supplementary material) of frequent and widespread saturation excess overland flow.', '2.1', '171', 'General description of the study site', 1, '2', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 297, 130, 297, 1, 1, 2),

Although infiltrability has been reduced under most land covers, it still exceeds even the highest short-term rainfall intensities with the exception of pasture, where Hortonian overland flow might be generated occasionally, e.g., in areas that are highly trampled and for large storms. Otherwise, this reduction has no discernable impact on the hydrological response.\n2. Ksat decreases with depth in the near surface according to land use: the more intensive the land use, the more pronounced the decrease. As a consequence, shallow perched water tables and possibly saturation overland flow develop more frequently under pasture and to some extend under teak than under natural conditions or succession.\n3. At a depth of 20 cm, the influence of land use on soil hydrological properties, and hence on runoff generation, diminishes, and all cover types except pasture are indistinguishable from the undisturbed setting.\n4. The secondary forest types capoeira and banana show lower infiltrabilities and similar Ksat than the primary forest, but these differences are likely without consequences for overland flow generation. Thus, a separate consideration of secondary forests, for instance, in large-scale hydrological models, does not seem warranted from a flowpath perspective: in this respect, they may be treated like primary forest. Knowledge of recovery time and previous land-use history may suggest a more discriminating approach.\n5. The effect of afforestation with commercial species on soil hydraulic properties depends strongly on the previous land use: while our teak plantation shows signs of recovery from pasture conditions regarding Ksat and infiltrability, this recovery is not nearly as pronounced as that from shorter periods of grazing or no grazing at all.\n6.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The Lutzito catchment is underlain by tuffaceous siltstone of the Caimito Marine Facies [Woodring, 1958]. Soils are classified as Eutric Cambisols [FAO, 1998] or, following USDA criteria [Soil Survey Staff, 2006], as Typic Eutrudepts [Baillie et al., 2007]. Soil depth varies between 0.3 m on some ridges and steep slopes and ∼1 m elsewhere. At the end of the dry season (May), and to a lesser extent during prolonged dry periods (June–July), soils in the Lutzito catchment develop cracks up to 2 cm wide and 10 cm deep (Figure 1g) due to a substantial admixture of smectite in the clay fraction [Grimm et al., 2008]. During the progressing wet season, cracks close and relative water saturation in the upper soils increases to >60% [Zimmermann et al., 2012]. The infiltrability far exceeds rainfall intensities (Table 1), but there is evidence for a strong decrease of the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) at a shallow depth (Table 1), which suggests the occurrence of saturation-excess overland flow (SOF). Several studies reported the frequent occurrence of overland flow in the Lutzito catchment [Godsey et al., 2004; Zimmermann et al., 2012], which dominates the runoff response. Return flow (e.g., from soil pipes) also constitutes a source of overland flow in the Lutzito catchment (A. Zimmermann, unpublished data), though its contribution to runoff remains unknown [Kinner and Stallard, 2004]. As mentioned earlier, overland flow in our research catchment tends to concentrate in flow lines [Loos and Elsenbeer, 2011]. Flow lines are microtopographic elements on hillslopes which feature particularly low Ks [Zimmermann et al., 2013] and extend the channel network (Figures 1c–1d). Though overland flow occurs most frequently in flow lines, surface runoff is not restricted to them [cf. Loos and Elsenbeer, 2011, Figure 3]. Particularly during large rain events, the vicinity of flow lines and other microtopographic positions such as swales also contribute to surface runoff [see Zimmermann et al., 2012, 2013, supporting information and video material]. None of the Lutzito catchment''s channels has perennial flow: base flow in the main channel ceases during the dry season, and flow in most tributary channels is either seasonal or ephemeral. In addition, riparian zones do not exist, an advantageous condition for studying hillslope-channel connectivity [McGuire and McDonnell, 2010]. [...] (1) In the study area, an overland-flow prone rain forest catchment, connectivity develops by the upslope expansion of the drainage network along flow lines from channel heads towards the divide.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Considering the entire RVC and its nested spatial organization, snowmelt, shallow groundwater and soil water were found to be the main contributors to stream runoff and spring recharge, but with different relative importance in the different parts of the catchment. Soil water and shallow groundwater are the dominant end-members in the soil-mantled subcatchments whereas rainfall and snowmelt play a more direct role on stream runoff and spring water in the upper part of RVC, characterized by rocky areas. A weak hydrochemical interaction between water input (rainfall and snowmelt) and soil and rocks, and little and relatively fast subsurface runoff exist in the rocky subcatchments  of  RVC,  characterized  by  waters  with  low  EC  and  highly  variable isotopic composition. Conversely, rainfall and snowmelt are likely characterized by longer residence times in the lower parts of RVC and in its soil-mantled subcatchments, and  represent  important  sources  for  baseflow  and  shallow  groundwater  recharge. These  findings,  coupled  to  hydrometric  data  and  geological  observations,  suggest the existence of two main water circulation systems at RVC that are hydrologically connected through the principal channel. There is a likely presence of a smaller and faster aquifer in the upper part of the catchment, and a deep and slow subsurface flow component in the lower part, responsible for stronger hydrochemical interactions between shallow subsurface water and soil (Penna et al., 2017). The main processes generating streamflow in the soil-mantled subcatchments of RVC, as BCC, where topography is characterized by steep slopes and a narrow riparian zone, include direct channel precipitation, saturation overland flow from the riparian zone, and shallow subsurface flow from the riparian zone and the hillslopes (Fig. 10). Channel precipitation and saturation overland flow onto saturated riparian areas provide the most important contribution to streamflow during dry conditions. This was revealed by i) the observed decrease of stream EC during the initial parts of rainfall events; ii) the increase of event water fractions in streamflow (as inferred from two-component hydrograph separation based on water isotopes) at approximately the same time of the EC decrease; and iii) the correlation between the magnitude of the EC decrease and the average event water contribution during this first part of the streamflow response (Penna et al., 2016). During dry antecedent moisture conditions, shallow subsurface flow develops mainly in the riparian zone, with no or negligible response of hillslope groundwater. This reflects in small runoff ratios and low stormflow values (Fig. 5), and small fractions of event water in the stream (Fig. 10a). Typically, the riparian zone is only partially saturated during dry conditions but saturated areas expand with increasing wetness conditions. Thus, during wet or very wet antecedent moisture conditions, such as large rainfall events or snowmelt events at the peak melting season, overland flow develops on the entire riparian zone. This reflects in higher contributions of event water to the stream (pie chart in Fig. 10b) compared  to  dry  conditions.  Moreover,  with  increasing  wetness,  shallow  subsurface flow develops in an increasing number of riparian and hillslope locations, as shown by response of piezometers, and above a certain threshold a larger area of the catchment contributes to streamflow, leading to a greater runoff production (Fig. 5).', '5', '417', 'Summary of runoff generation processes at RVC and future research', 3, '2', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 300, 189, 300, 3, 5, 2),

Monitoring of the topsoil physical properties shows seasonal variability, but we have not identified a clear relationship between actual soil conditions and dominant runoff formation mechanism in the studied catchment. The surface runoff, mostly  saturated excess driven, occurs only seldom and was caused by heavy rainfall in combination with high antecedent catchment saturation.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Ground water in the Neversink watershed typically discharges as seeps or springs at the base of steep slopes and from rock outcrops, or discharges directly into the stream channel. Discharge of water from deep ground-water sources occurs throughout the year, and is the principal source of stream flow during the dry summer months. This water has typically moved through bedrock fractures and bedding planes (fig. 2), and generally remains below the surface for several months to more than one year. Some water moves through the matrix of the bedrock, but much slower than through the fractures and bedding planes. The discharge rate of these springs tends to vary from season to season, but does not respond to individual storms (fig. 3A; Burns and others, 1998). During extended periods of rainfall or snowmelt, rates of recharge can exceed rates of discharge, which results in upward movement of the water table (the level below which all pore spaces and fractures are filled with water). In March or April the water table is likely to be in the soil profile, within centimeters of the surface, whereas in late summer, the water table is likely to be below the soil profile, and possibly below the till (fig. 3B, Burns and others, 1998). As the water table rises, subsurface water is able to discharge from the till and the soil, as well as from bedrock (fig. 2). When the water table rises into the soil, high stream flow is maintained between storms, and rapid increases in stream flow occur during rainstorms and snowmelt, as ephemeral streams form in channels that are dry throughout most of the year. Stream water under these conditions is a mixture of ground water and soil water that reflects a range of subsurface-residence times. During drier times of the year, heavy rainstorms can also rapidly increase stream flows for short periods of time, through lateral transport of water through the soil and upper ground water reservoirs, even though the water table is deep in the till or bedrock (Brown and others, 1999). Once the rain stops, however, streamflow quickly recedes to low, pre-storm levels.

Overland flow is minimal in Walker Branch as a result of very high infiltration capacity of surface soils, but convergence of subsurface flow on hillslopes results in initiation of surface flow in an extensive network of ephemeral stream channels during storms, consistent with predictions from a topography-based model (Clapp et al., 1992). Recent studies conducted in a small (0.5 ha), upper hillslope subcatchment of Walker Branch have shown that perched water tables develop in the upper soil profile in response to moderate-large storms and generate most of the subsurface stormflow via macropores during these events (Wilson and Luxmoore 1988; Wilson et al., 1990, 1991a). Studies of solute transport in this subcatchment have indicated extensive flushing of water held in small pores in the soil matrix into the preferential flow network during storms (Jardine et al., 1990; Wilson et al., 1991b). Studies of storm hydrogeochemical response at the whole catchment scale showed that both shallow and deep flowpaths were important in generating storm streamflow and that water chemistry differed considerably between flowpaths (Mulholland et al., 1990). More recently, Genereux et al. (1993b), using 222Rn and Ca concentrations in an end-member mixing analysis, identified three distinct flowpaths generating streamflow in Walker Branch, the importance of each varying spatially (along the perennial stream) and with streamflow.

Groundwater flow in the fractured bedrock zone is dynamic and may be an important flow pathway along the hillslope via a well-connected fracture network. The seasonal variation of the water levels in the nested piezometers and higher elevations during winter verify active groundwater recharge and discharge occurring along the hillslope and that groundwater movement is from the higher parts of the catchment to the valley bottom. Groundwater flow in the fractured bedrock aquifer appears to be significant. It is hypothesised that the hydraulic properties and high degree of connection between the soil, saprolite and fractured bedrock zones is a dominant control on the major contribution of groundwater to Scott Creek. The hydraulic and hydrochemical data suggests that the groundwater in the fractured bedrock zone is relatively well mixed and that there is some mixing of this water with the shallower groundwater in the soil and saprolite zones where the groundwater flow paths converge at the valley bottom prior to discharge to the creek. The data also shows that there is a hydraulic disconnection between the soil and saprolite zones with the deeper fractured bedrock in the upslope areas of the study site as a result of the increasing thickness of the soil and saprolite zones. Perched aquifers are established in the shallow soil zone and persist throughout the year. These shallow aquifer systems may play an important role in overland and throughflow to the creek as well as a ‘solute’ mixing zone of shallow and deep groundwater. Previous studies (Smettem et al. 1991; Leaney et al. 1993) at the Scott Creek field site have assumed that subsurface flow occurs in the shallow saprolite zone only. In striking contrast, the results of this study are important because they clearly show that groundwater flow in the deeper fractured bedrock zone is highly dynamic and an important groundwater flow pathway along the hillslope and readily exchanges with the creek. As a result, deep groundwater from the fractured bedrock aquifer is therefore expected to be a significant component in streamflow generation at Scott Creek.

This leads to an increase in soil moisture content, but a lack of conductivity prevents ground- water levels from rising in conjunction with soil moisture. As a result, the discharge during this phase is hardly sensitive to storage changes up to a storage in- crease of ∼30 mm. \n2. Groundwater response – the unsaturated zone is near saturation and additional rainfall readily leads to saturation of the soil matrix. Under these conditions the specific yield μ is very small (0.06 over a large part of the storage increase in Fig. 11) and groundwater levels can rise rapidly. Since groundwater levels strongly control the field-scale subsurface flow to the network of secondary and tertiary ditches, the discharge is moderately sensitive to changes in total catchment storage. The rapid rise of groundwater levels continues up to a storage increase of ∼120–130 mm, when groundwater levels reach the surface and ponding occurs. \n3. Surface depression filling and surface runoff – when ponding occurs, two mechanisms come into play with contrasting effects on the discharge increase. First, the specific yield strongly increases (since for ponded areas μ = 1), effectively reducing the increase in hydraulic heads in response to rainfall. Secondly, however, when ponds start to connect to the network of ditches, over- land flow becomes an important runoff mechanism and discharge increases rapidly. This is a typical mechanism during flash floods, and the moment at which overland flow is initiated determines for a large part the timing of flash flood response (Marchi et al., 2010). This is also the case in the Hupsel Brook catchment. The slope of the line in Fig. 11a is very steep between total catchment storage of 120 mm and 135 mm.

The relative contribution to total quickflow from subcatchment A is also positively correlated with API, suggesting that as antecedent conditions become wetter, the lower swampy valley floor in Hut Creek produces an increasing share of total quickflow relative to the rest of the catchment. The nonsignificant (D, E, F) and negative (B, C) regression coefficients on API for other subcatchments suggest that subcatchments with mixed influences or dominated by subsurface stormflow are less influenced by antecedent wetness. \n3.

In addition, since 50% of the drainage from the catchment bypasses the Pukemanga weir, more than 87% of the total catchment drainage is via groundwater flow. Mean catchment residence times were estimated from the weekly variations in 18 O concentrations, and from 3 H, CFC and SF 6 concentrations, for sites ranging from Pukemanga Stream baseflow, through perennial seepage (Below Waterfall spring), to ephemeral flows after rainfall. Input functions for 18 O and 3 H to the deep subsurface water stores were determined from measured rainfall data, adjusted for immediate runoff and ET. Baseflow and perennial seepage had mean residence times of 4 years or greater, whereas the ephemeral flows had varying amounts of short-residence-time soil water and immediate rainfall. SiO 2 concentrations were used to identify flowpaths, with rainfall/surface runoff having concentrations of 0–5 mg lÐ1 and deep groundwater seepage having 20–25 mg lÐ1 . The mean residence time of the Pukemanga Stream baseflow was 9 years from the 3 H measurements, with a wide distribution of ages peaking at close to zero years and a long tail of older water.

The unsaturated and saturated zones hold large volumes of slowly moving water that give long residence times within the catchment. The unsaturated zone is considered to impose a delay of about 4 years on the water moving vertically through it, but to rapidly transmit rainfall-induced pressure fluctuations that contribute to fast stormflow response following rainfall (along with ephemeral surface/near-surface flows).

This recharge takes place far away from  the  stream (>loom) and  probably  does not participate in the  generation of stormflow.  Instead, it is likely that stormflows are initiated by the  generation of overland flow. In Harra, on cattle tracks  and  eroded areas, a  soil surface water film developed within minutes of the  onset of  rainfall, and soon thereafter  turned into  Hortonian overland flow. Saturation overland flow was observed  only on the mbuga. However, probably not all of the overland flow reached the stream. In this context, Bone11 and Williams (1986) have reported that considerable runoff-runon   redistribution of surface water can occur. The small ratio of runoff to rainfall in Harra (annual stormflow accounts for less than 6 mm, i.e. < 1 % of the annual P, and large individual  events  comprise about 1 % of event  rainfall; Sandstrom, 1995) indicates that the  runoff-runon   redistribution of surface  water is also important in Harra. When such  surface water reaches and enters macropores,  and exceeds the  lateral absorption capacity of macropore walls, a  rapid delivery of surface water  deep into the profile will commence which, in turn, may cause  a  groundwater ridging mechanism to discharge pre-event water into the  stream. Such delivery,  which  is here  referred to as the 7-flow, has been discussed by,  e.g. Germann (1986), McDonnell (1990) and Beven and  Germann (1982). Still, Buttle and Sami (1992) argue that studies describing such a flow, while failing to supply hydrometric evidence, should be treated with caution. This is the case in Harra, where a hydrochemically groundwater- resembling water enters the stream during storm events. It suggests a riparian groundwater ridging mechanism, although the hydrometric evidence of this are lacking. Germann (1986) argued that only macropore flow can explain the transmission of rainwater into the soil mantle at a speed sufficient to allow a rapid groundwater discharge. A rapid  transmission can be seen in Figure 11, where pre-event water actually appeared before peak flow.

Within the dambo, where the soil profile is not completely saturated, the closeness of the perched watertable to the ground surface probably ensures that the capillary fringe (i.e. the region above the watertable which is under ten­sion but remains close to saturation) will extend to the sur­face. Under such circumstances, application of only a small amount of water can result in a large and rapid rise of the watertable (Jayatilika and Gillham, 1996), and the extent of expansion of the saturated region will be very sensitive to the amount and, to a lesser extent, to the intensity of rainfall.', 'N/A', '74', 'DAMBO RAINFALL-RUNOFF RELATIONSHIPS', 1, '1', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 316, 83, 316, 1, 2, 2),

The storm-flow coefficient was mainly related to soil moisture and water-table depth, with values higher than 2% only during the wet winter period, suggesting that subsurface flow played a primary role in runoff production at the basin scale. The seasonal dynamics of soil moisture, water-table depth and stream discharge observed at the valley bottom of the Baratz catchment enabled us to recognize three seasonal periods of the water year, characterised by different dominant runoff formation processes: 1) summer and autumn, which have high water-table depths, low soil moisture and no stream discharge even when there is intense rainfall, which infiltrates into the soil and increases the water content and water-table level, without producing HOF; 2) winter, which has low water-table depths, high soil moisture and storm-flow generated by the SOF over saturated areas and by the SSF through pipes, macropores and seepage zones in the soil; 3) spring, which has low water-table depths, low soil moisture and slow baseflow generated by the exfiltration of SSF through the soil matrix.

Riparian groundwater was likely a major source of streamflow, and lateral inflow from the riparian zone to the stream channel dominated at all three gauge sites. Precipitation was weak and less frequent, and the response of soil moisture to storm flow was slower than that of streamflow. Precipitation did not translate to an increase in groundwater level, suggesting disconnection of the hillslope from the stream and groundwater.\nDuring the wet period, groundwater level and soil moisture were increased by a large amount of precipitation. In addition to lateral inflow, strong upwelling in the riparian zone of the zero-order basin increased water yield at Gup. The water yield at Gmid did not show as large an increase as at Gup and Gdown, which may be attributable to the sandy permeable substrate and longitudinal gradient in the midstream reach. The upstream water yield exceeded that downstream during the wet period. During storm flow, the response of soil moisture preceded that of streamflow, and this translated to an increase in groundwater level. This suggests that the hillslope was connected to the stream and that subsurface flow may appear during and after the rain event.\nDuring the dry-down period, upstream water yield efficiency remained higher than that downstream, although the water yield declined throughout the catchment.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The winter runoff generation model begins with a baseflow component, in which deep aquifer discharge is the only process contributing to streamflow. In the cases studied, the maximum flow did not exceed 3.0 m3 day- ’ (spring zone discharge plus evaporation). After rainfall commences, initial infiltration rapidly resaturates the capillary fringe, producing a response akin to groundwater ridging (Sklash and Farvolden, 1989), saturation overland flow and the first stormflow response. In particular, it also generates throughflow and the initial purge (via groundwater ridging) of stored salts which had accumulated in the A horizon. Continuing rain enlarges the saturated variable source area, producing the observed increases in the volumes of saturation overland flow and peak throughflow. When the hydraulic head of the perched aquifer rises above the soil surface, due to the expansion of the variable source area upslope, returnflow begins. When rainfall ceases, the recession period is dominated by returnflow and throughflow, once saturation overland flow has been removed ( < 60 min) from the hillslope. Later in the recession period, returnflow also ceases as water-levels drop in the perched aquifer and the variable source area decays. Throughflow occurs at diminishing rates (controlled by Darcian hydraulics) until the variable source area has fully decayed, when deep groundwater discharge again maintains streamflow. Summer runoff mechanisms are controlled by the degree of surface compaction caused by stock, hydrophobic soil conditions and the level of antecedent moisture on the hillslope. The summer model begins with a prolonged no-flow period (evaporation exceeds deep groundwater discharge), until rainfall resaturates the capillary fringe (saline seep) and saturation overland flow occurs. Reduced soil-surface permeability on the hillslope caused by stock and the soil’s hydrophobic nature, result in infiltration-excess and post-ponding overland flows dominating the hydrograph peak. However, as soil-moisture levels increase on the hillslope, infiltration increases and some of the infiltration-excess and post-ponding flows generated in the upper slopes, may fail to reach the weir. Prolonged storm events may cause saturation of the A horizon across an expanding variable source area, reactivating returnflow in rare cases. However, in most cases summer storms cease quickly and the recession period is characterized by throughflow. High evaporation rates cause both the expanded variable source area and saline seep to dry rapidly, returning to the unsaturated vertical flow processes across the seep, and the no-flow condition recommences in the stream. Evaporation begins to concentrate salts in the soils and maintains the process of salinization, temporarily interrupted by leaching from storm generated throughflow.', 'N/A', '305', 'Towards a runofl model', 1, '3', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 319, 156, 319, 1, 10, 2),

During summer storm events, the surface runoff and near-surface throughflow components of stormflow contributed directly to peak QO, while inputs to streamflow from the slower process of groundwater recharge contributed more to the falling limb of the hydrograph. Groundwater levels further upslope from riparian areas were found to be very responsive during rainfall events, but downslope riparian areas buffered this response to lag peak QO. During pure radiation-induced melt events, meltwaters initially contributed more to groundwater recharge than to the surface runoff and near-surface throughflow components of stormflow. As groundwater levels progressively rose, however, the transmissivity feedback mechanism became increasingly active, and more conductive superficial flowpaths rapidly transported ever greater amounts of lateral flow to streams. This resulted in a strong coupling of riparian area groundwater fluctuations to runoff during melt events, with peak groundwater levels experiencing little or no lag to peak QO.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'We interpret that groundwater discharge dominates headwater streamflow generation in the merokarst of N04D, during both high and low flow conditions (Fig. 8). Contributions from surface runoff are only important during some storms, and contributions from soil water are volumetrically insignificant across the entire wet season. These behaviors are in contrast to the widespread shallow-and-deep hypothesis of streamflow generation, which states that contributions to streamflow from shallow units (i.e. surface runoff and soil water) become increasingly more important relative to deep units (i.e. groundwater) under wet conditions. While studies conducted at non-karstic catchments of similar size to N04D generally support the shallow-and-deep hypothesis, we hold that the karstic properties of N04D prevent the development of such a regime. Thin soils place an upper limit on the significance of shallow flow paths, while soil macropores and bedrock fractures rapidly route water to limestone aquifers ensuring that deep flow paths remain dominant even during very wet conditions. Given that groundwater flow paths are critical in sustaining streamflow, our finding that there are groundwater storage thresholds which govern subsurface connections to the stream then implies that these thresholds are major controllers on stream intermittency. Significant, sustained streamflow can only occur when enough precipitation has fallen in a short enough amount of time to surpass the groundwater storage thresholds.\nThe thinly bedded nature of the limestones at N04D means that its hydrological behavior also deviates from what is typically seen in massive karst systems. Confining mudstone layers largely restrict vertical movement of water between limestones and the unique depositional history of each individual limestone bed means that each one might possess unique hydrogeological properties. Whether caused by differences in hydraulic conductivity or simple stratigraphic position, our results show that each of our studied limestone aquifers, which are vertically separated by only a couple of meters from one another, respond to recharge and interact with the stream in different ways (Fig. 4). This heterogeneity expands the capacity of the subsurface to act as a hydrological buffer, in that each limestone unit releases recharge into the stream at a different rate to effectively extend the amount of time that the stream can flow. Consistent with this observation, streams across the Flint Hills region of Kansas have greater proportions of baseflow in total streamflow than streams in adjacent, non-merokarstic regions,62 suggesting that the merokarst bedrock does improve hydrological buffering.', '4.6', '128', 'Implications', 1, '1', 'N', 'N', 'Geological types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 321, 252, 321, 1, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The first event (Fig. 6a) was an intense rainstorm that occurred in dry summer conditions. [...] The small storm-flow coefficient associated with this event, the short response time of peakflow, the extremely limited rise in the water table at 1.5 m depth, and the rapid recession of flow all suggest that during this type of flood the infiltration excess runoff (directly into the stream channel or upon impervious and non-vegetated areas close to it) is likely to be the only runoff process active within the catchment in response to intense rainfall events. The high suspended sediment concentrations associated with this flood (>4 g l−1) confirm these findings and are in accordance with the work of Lana-Renault et al. (2007), who observed that floods under dry conditions and intense rainfall events are characterised by high suspended sediment concentrations. Similarly, Latron and Gallart, 1995, Martínez-Mena et al., 1998 described infiltration excess runoff processes in the more degraded areas of Mediterranean and semi-arid Mediterranean catchments, respectively.\nThe event on 15th October 2005 (Fig. 6b) occurred during the wetting-up period, following several autumn rainfalls. [...] For this event, piezometer data indicate that surface saturation was attained in at least parts of the catchment; this possibly favoured the development of saturation excess runoff in localised areas. The saturation excess runoff, in combination with a minor contribution from infiltration excess runoff over impervious areas, generated a larger response than that observed during summertime conditions. Grésillon and Taha (1998) already showed that in Mediterranean conditions, saturation excess runoff could cause large floods. In addition, Latron and Gallart (2007) confirmed the relevance of saturated areas for streamflow generation.\nThe event on 23rd September 2006 (Fig. 6c) also occurred during the wetting-up period, although with slightly wetter antecedent conditions than the event described above. [...] The significantly larger streamflow response observed for the 23rd September event resulted from the rapid and extended saturation of soils within the catchment; this favoured saturation excess runoff over large areas, probably strongly connected to the stream. In addition to saturation excess runoff, the contribution of infiltration excess runoff upon low-permeability areas, arising from the high intensity of the rainfall, also probably helped to generate one of the largest floods observed in the Arnás catchment. Finally, the radically different magnitudes of streamflow response of the two wetting-up events described above raises the question of the existence of a threshold effect in the Arnás catchment, similar to that described by Cosandey (1993) for the Mont Lozère Mediterranean catchments. The existence of a threshold effect in the Arnás catchment that clearly differentiates between large and small streamflow responses requires further investigation, however, as no clear changes were observed in the trend of the event-scale rainfall–streamflow relationship (Fig. 2).\nThe event on 2nd December 2005 (Fig. 6d) occurred during the wet period, with a baseflow of 5.4 l s−1 km−2. [...] The moderate nature of the streamflow response recorded under wet conditions, despite the observed saturation at locations w7, w8, and w9, can be explained by the fact that even during wet periods the extension of saturated areas prone to saturation excess runoff is relatively limited within the Arnás catchment. Indeed, field mapping during wet conditions demonstrated that surface saturation is restricted mainly to the valley bottom and occasionally at sites located more than 200 m from the main channel; consequently, once a certain level of saturation had been reached the contribution of saturation excess runoff during wet conditions was presumably not significantly higher than that for wetting-up periods. In contrast, the typical slow response and long recession observed during wet conditions suggests that the contribution of a slow flow component (i.e., subsurface flow within the soil matrix) is characteristic for events during wet conditions when non-saturated soils (which represent the majority of the catchment area) are able to absorb large, low-intensity rainfalls. During wet conditions, both saturation excess runoff and subsurface flow were probably the dominant runoff processes operating within the catchment, whereas infiltration excess runoff (if it occurred at all) was insignificant because of the low rainfall intensities. Previous studies such as Taha et al. (1997) reported that subsurface flow may be an important runoff process in Mediterranean areas.', 'N/A', '503', 'Analysis of the streamflow and groundwater response at the event scale', 1, '3', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 322, 10, 322, 1, 1, 2),

This pattern, and the very small sub-daily fluctuations in the isotopic signal during the accumulation, melt, and post-melt phases suggest a long transit time in the catchment for water inputs from snowmelt and precipitation. This is somewhat surprising, given the small size of the catchment and its impermeable granitic lithology and large areas of rocky outcrops. It is likely that Peñalara Lake, which drains 34 % of the catchment surface area and has a mean turnover time of 9 days (Toro et al., 2006), plays a role in mixing water inputs over several days, and so buffers some of the potential daily and sub-daily variability in water inputs (Leach and Laudon, 2019). However, this is not a sufficient explanation of the steady evolution of isotope enrichment and the absence of sub-daily fluctuations. The most plausible explanation is groundwater storage in coarse sediments (e.g., talus and moraines) that act as alpine aquifers (Hayashi, 2020, Tague and Grant, 2009). These types of deposits are abundant in the catchment and have an important role in the underground hydrology (Yélamos et al., 2019). The importance of the groundwater storage must explain that single isotope inputs are not quickly transferred to stream response.\nAlthough the runoff has a relatively direct response to water inputs (showing sub-daily cycles), in particular during snowmelt period in snow dominated catchments (Krogh et al., 2022), the absence of variability in the isotope composition suggests that alpine aquifers acted as an intermediate reservoir. The Peñalara Massif has greater subsurface drainage than the surrounding mountains, where most of the streams are dry or have very low baseflow during the warmest and driest period, suggesting the importance of groundwater contributions (Yélamos et al., 2019). Thus, as has been hypothesized for river basins of Svalbard (Blaen et al., 2014), we assume that daily melt water or rainfall infiltrates into alpine aquifers and displaces the previously stored water (piston flow), rather than following a direct meltwater or rainfall runoff scheme (Yang et al., 2012).

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Zhurucay is an energy-limited and water abundant system. It has two dominant landscape units that differ markedly in hydrological functioning: hillslopes and valley-bottom wetlands. The hillslopes are characterized by volcanic ash soils known as Andosols with tussock grass vegetation and cover 78 % of the catchment area. The valley-bottom wetlands are mainly composed of organic-rich, peat-type soils known as Histosols and cover 22 % of the catchment (Lazo et al., 2019, Mosquera et al., 2015). These wetlands are generally recharged by the hillslope Andosols. The wetlands close to the stream network significantly influence the water yield in Zhurucay. The chemical composition of the soils is composed of high contents of aluminum, iron, and other metals (Buytaert et al., 2005, Buytaert et al., 2006b). Another important feature is the high subsurface hydrological connectivity between hillslopes (Andosols) and wetlands (Histosols) during rainstorm events (Correa et al., 2019). Andosols have a lower saturated hydraulic conductivity (47 % less), and porosity (16 % less), than the shallow organic soil layers of the Histosols (Lazo et al., 2019, Mosquera et al., 2016a). Vertical soil water movement is driven by a quicker response of a shallow “organic soil horizon”, compared to the slower response of deeper soil layers (Table 1) (Crespo et al., 2012, Lazo et al., 2019, Mosquera et al., 2016a, Mosquera et al., 2021). The main runoff generation process is therefore the shallow subsurface flow in Histosols and Andosols. These differences in the páramo soils properties and distribution within the catchment affect the transport of water from the hillslopes (streams and soils) to the wetlands and therefore the regulation of water quantity and quality downstream.\n\nGenerally, rainfall that infiltrates the soil on the upper to the middle slope (Andosols) flows laterally through the shallow organic soil (Mosquera et al., 2016b). As it reaches the bottom of the slope (Histosols), more vertical flow paths are activated and the water reaches more hydrologically inactive zones in the wetlands (Mosquera et al., 2016a). Hortonian overland flow in these soils is rare due to the high porosity, infiltration capacity, and hydraulic conductivity of the soils, which is higher than typical rainfall intensities (Table 1). Observations indicate that Histosols remain close to saturation year-round; saturation is reached during periods of sustained rainfall or high-intensity rainfall events (Correa et al., 2019, Mosquera et al., 2016a).\n\nSprings sourced by shallow groundwater also contribute to streamflow. The geology in Zhurucay is mainly composed by compacted volcanic rocks from the Quimsacocha (basaltic flows with plagioclases, feldspars, and andesitic pyroclasts), and Turi (tuffaceous andesitic breccias, conglomerates, and horizontal stratified sands) formations (Coltorti and Ollier, 2000). Hydrogeological surveys near Zhurucay revealed a shallow fractured rock layer of around 20 m depth (ITASCA DENVER Inc., 2020). This layer is hydraulically disconnected from the deeper bedrock which has a very low (“quasi-compact”) permeability. Therefore, low deep groundwater contributions to streams were observed at Zhurucay traveling through mineral soil, especially during low flow conditions (Correa et al., 2017).', '2', '2', 'Study site and current understanding of hydrological processes', 2, '1', 'Vegetation described', 'Soil types described', 'Geological types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 325, 272, 325, 2, 2, 2),

The contribution of event water to storm runoff is remarkably small, given that impermeable structures (roads, tracks, farmyards...) account for 5% of the catchment area. If all the rainwater falling on these structures had reached the stream, it would have accounted for the total discharge observed. It is likely that most of this water infiltrates and contributes indirectly to streamflow, after mixing or by piston flow. Therefore, it confirms Beven''s quotation (1991) that equating event water with runoff water is misleading. The hydrograph separation shows complex mixing patterns involving an early contribution of groundwater quickly replaced by hillslope subsurface water, and a delayed, moderate contribution of seepage from the riparian area. This suggests that, for this type of events, stormflow generation is dominated by pressure transfer processes, linked to a quick supply of water from the hillslope, probably due to macropore flow routed to the stream by the ditch network. This highlighted the interest of not sticking to the ''classical'' two-component model, especially when dealing with water quality issues. In particular, the results presented here show that the riparian zone water, low in nitrate due to denitrification (Curmi et al., 1995), contributes but for a minor part to streamflow. This low contribution is due, first, to the relatively limited extension of the saturated zone at this time of the year, and second, to the many by-passes that bring the water contaminated by nitrate directly to the stream channel.

The climate is humid temperate: the mean annual rainfall recorded over the last 22 years is 713 mm, while the mean annual temperature and mean annual runoff recorded over the same period are 11 °C and 305 mm, respectively (Morel et al., 2009). Rainfall events rarely exceed 20 mm per day, and 80% of precipitations have intensity less than 4 mm per hour. Most of the storm events occur between November and March. Due to the small volume of water stored in the schist bedrock, the stream usually dries up from the end of August to the beginning of November. Ninety percent of the catchment area is dedicated to intensive agriculture, being composed mainly of pastures, maize and cereals for dairy production and pig breeding. Note that the intensive agriculture carried out on the Kervidy-Naizin catchment has led to heavy nitrate pollution with a mean nitrate concentration in the stream of around 70 mg L−1 (Molénat et al., 2008).\n\nSoils in the catchment have developed into a loamy material derived from bedrock weathering and aeolian Quaternary deposits. All the soils are classified as Luvisols. Nevertheless, the poor drainage in the bottomland domain leads to seasonal waterlogging with the development of hydromorphic soils. The hydrology of the catchment can be summarized by the contrast of two domains depending on water-table fluctuations: (i) a hillslope domain, where the water table always remains a few metres below the soil surface and is associated with essentially vertical water pathways, and (ii) a wetland domain where the water table usually reaches the soil surface during the wet season, namely, winter and spring (Molénat et al., 2008). The extent of this wetland domain is highly variable, ranging from 5% to 20% of the total surface area of the catchment depending on hydroclimatic conditions (Gascuel-Odoux et al., 1998).\n\nSoil organic carbon (SOC) contents show two well marked gradients (Morel et al., 2009): (i) a rapid and strong decrease with depth: e.g. from 4.4% at 0–10 cm depth to 0.1% at 80–100 cm depth in wetland areas close to the stream network, and (ii) a progressive decline with increasing distance to the stream network: e.g. from 4.4% at 0–10 cm close to the stream down to 0.9% at 0–10 cm, 400 m away from the stream.\n\nPrevious studies focusing on water pathways and solute sources in the Kervidy-Naizin catchment showed that the uppermost soils of the wetland areas (between 0 and 30 cm depth) are the main sources of DOC and waters during storm events, accounting for 60–85% and 35% of the DOC and water fluxes, respectively (Mérot et al., 1995, Durand and Torres, 1996, Gascuel-Odoux et al., 1998, Molénat et al., 1999, Morel et al., 2009). More specifically, four water reservoirs have been identified as contributing to the stream flow in this catchment: (i) rainfall; (ii) deep (>3 m) groundwater; (iii) wetland soil water (including wetland runoff); and (iv) shallow (between 1 and 3 m deep), hillslope groundwater (Mérot et al., 1995, Durand and Torres, 1996, Morel et al., 2009).

Nine rainfall events of infiltration-excess dominated hillslopes were analysed and found that only high-intensity rainfall events were able to convert 1–5% of runoff at the outlet. The extremely low patch of soil hydraulic conductivity (<5 mm/h) was located at the outlet in agro-forested hillslope whereas similar low soil hydraulic conductivity patch is located at the end portion in a grassed hillslope. Therefore, the grassed hillslope generated less runoff than the agro-forested hillslope due to its surface resistance and heterogeneity in soil hydraulic conductivity. The runoff generated from the upper part of hillslope re-infiltrated into the middle part due to higher soil hydraulic conductivity. During low and medium intensity rainfall conditions, major runoff contribution was observed from low conductivity zones of the hillslope. Moreover, we analysed the correlation of spatial variation in soil moisture with topographic wetness index (TWI) and soil hydraulic conductivity in two different landuse conditions to examine the predictive potential of these attributes during the wet and dry season. The optimal formulation of TWI was obtained from 72 different combinations using linear mixed effects modelling. The correlation between optimal TWI formulation and soil moisture was found to be negative as the main streamline is located near low conductivity zones. Furthermore, the correlation between TWI and soil moisture is stronger in the dry season than the wet season. In comparison to grass cover hillslope, agro-forested landuse system shows better negative correlation between soil moisture and TWI during the wet season as the agro-forested hillslope produced more runoff than the grassed hillslope.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Almost 40 years after the suspension of grazing, we find no evidence that water from the uplands is being routed to drainage areas at LCRA. These findings are contrary to the prevailing hypothesis that drainage areas continue to receive water subsidies and are more mesic than the uplands (Archer 1995, Wu and Archer 2005, Parker et al 2010). During the 20 months of our study, overland flow was nonexistent despite some relatively large rainfall events. Our soil moisture measurements also provide strong evidence that there is little if any redistribution of water from the uplands to the lower-lying drainage-woodlands. If such redistribution were occurring, there would be dramatic differences in soil moisture between the two landforms. For example, in banded vegetation drylands of Australia, soil moisture levels were 5 times higher in downslope tree groves than in adjacent upland intercanopy areas (Ludwig et al 2005). In contrast, our measurements showed insignificant differences in soil moisture. Further, our comparison of soil infiltrability and field saturated hydraulic conductivity between our ungrazed study site and the nearby grazed site demonstrates that even moderate grazing pressure dramatically diminished soil infiltrability and likely led to much higher surface runoff. Weltz and Blackburn (1995) monitored runoff from large (5 m × 7 m) plots over a 20-month period at our study site and found that runoff was still being generated from the upland areas 40 years ago (soon after the removal of livestock). They found that for rainfall events larger than 100 mm, runoff could be as high as 8% of rainfall. It is quite likely that 150 years ago, when the site was subjected to severe overgrazing, runoff from the uplands into the drainage areas was much higher.\n\nThe prevailing evidence suggests that relaxation of grazing along with an increase in woody plants has greatly reduced hydrologic connectivity between the uplands and the drainage areas—which could explain the complete cessation of subsidy inputs to the drainage-woodlands. We postulate that at our site, the drainage areas were more mesic under the overgrazed conditions of the past, owing to a more ecohydrologically connected state. While fire suppression and grazing may have been the primary triggers for recruitment and expansion of woody plants, it is likely that the greater water availability in the drainage-woodlands made this location more favorable for WPE. This proposition is supported by the higher SOC accumulation and the greater mean age of stands in the drainage-woodlands, noted by Boutton et al (1998). In other words, the hydrological state of the landscape must have been a crucial factor in determining the patterns of recruitment in the earlier stages of WPE.', 'N/A', '8', 'The combination of rangeland recovery and WPE alters ecohydrological connectivity', 2, '1', 'Vegetation described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 329, 118, 329, 8, 2, 2),

The predominance of interannual variability in the glacierized basin streamflow was due to hydrometeorological factors that affected ice melt with much smaller impacts from firn melt and rainfall-runoff. Annual streamflow was significantly correlated with annual air temperature, as well as summer rainfall and winter snowfall. The negative correlation with winter snowfall and with timing of ice exposure, concomitant with the lack of association between snowmelt and streamflow indicates that winter conditions play a role in streamflow variability by regulating subsequent summer ice exposure and albedo in the PGRB. Lower snowfall reduces summer albedo on the glacier. Snowmelt, whilst generating a larger fraction of streamflow, was a small source of interannual streamflow variability because high snowfall years were also low ice melt years due to the impact of deep snowpack in covering and protecting glacier ice from melting until late in the summer.\n\nA comparison of high and low streamflow years showed that streamflow in high flow years was 41% greater than in low flow years. High flow years were warmer (+1.43°C), rainier (+145 mm) and less snowy (−295 mm w.e.) than low flow years. These differences in temperature and precipitation caused earlier snowmelt (−10 days), enhanced ice melt (+103%) and firn melt (+162%), and greater rainfall-runoff (+146%). As low snowfall years were warmer and rainier years than high snowfall years, rainfall and firn melt runoff sources also increased with ice melt in these years.

Model development based on these studies included short and longwave radiation under canopies, turbulent transfer under canopies and the interception, unloading and sublimation of snow in forest canopies. Model results showed that slope and aspect are not important for melt under forest canopies but are extremely important for forest clearings (Ellis et al. 2013). In the alpine zone around Fisera Ridge, studies of blowing snow transport and sublimation and snowmelt on slopes were conducted. MacDonald et al. (2010) found that 20% of alpine seasonal snowfall sublimated from blowing snow and that snow was almost completely eroded from windblown slopes, causing deposition on lee slopes to be more than double snowfall.

Two factors operating together led to this hydrological effect: (1) tall permanent grass cover is effective in trapping snow, so that the wind-driven transport of snow into wetlands is reduced in grassed catchments; (2) the undisturbed grasscover leads to the development of a macropore network in the topsoil, which increases soil infiltrability, especially during the snowmelt period when the soil is frozen. The macropore network takes several years to develop after introduction of the grass, as indicated by the delayed hydrological response of the wetlands to the cultivated-to-grass conversion. Increased dryness of the soil beneath the grass is also a contributing factor, but its contribution is relatively minor.

In 1967, the water level in upper valley well M1 was 293.6 m asl (Mink 1978). The streambed elevation near M1 is 294 m asl, which implies that groundwater discharge to the stream probably occurred at this location. The discharge of dike-impounded water, as either underflow, overflow, or discharge to the stream, becomes potential recharge to downgradient aquifers (Takasaki and Mink 1985).

Since 1968, freshwater from the valley has been used to irrigate two golf courses in the mid- and lower valleys (Fig. 1) and as local municipal water supply. Thus, a potential for groundwater recharge resulting from irrigation may exist in the mid- to lower valleys.

A steep increase in discharge occurs in May, when snow melt at high altitudes coincides with the first monsoon rains in lower regions, soil thaws and becomes saturated (Figure 2). Variability in soil moisture after saturation is driven by precipitation events that result in high altitude snow fall and almost immediate melt shortly thereafter. By early June, the soil is near-saturated due to the snow melt, monsoon precipitation begins, and high elevation snow and ice melt is occurring. As a result the discharge rises rapidly, and has marked diurnal peaks. From then onwards, precipitation events measured at 5000 m a.s.l. are clearly and immediately visible in both soil moisture and discharge in the valley (Figure 2).\n\nThe streamflow decreases steeply in September as the monsoon withdraws. A distinct diurnal cycle is observed throughout the year, with low/high flows in the late morning/early afternoon in January and early afternoon/midnight in May, respectively.\n\nThe availability of multiple measured variables at different elevations, provides the opportunity to evaluate multiple processes at the catchment scale and validate models, especially related to the cryosphere and complex precipitation patterns typical for high mountain regions.\n\nPrevious research in the catchment shows a strong elevational gradient of precipitation, which peaks above 1500 mm annually around 3000 m a.s.l.

Their dynamics gave useful information on the dominant hydrological processes of polygonal tundra catchments:\nAlthough evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation during the summer, lateral outflow of water is of the same order of magnitude. The related storage decrease throughout the catchment highlights the importance of the wintertime snow cover for refilling the water storages and balancing the annual water budget.\n\nLateral surface and subsurface water fluxes are found to strongly control the redistribution of storage (snow melt) water during the summer period. These lateral fluxes are subject to high spatial and temporal variations, which are largely related to the microtopography and the thaw dynamics of the polygonal tundra. In the course of the summer, the thaw depth increases, which opens new pathways for subsurface water flow and decreases the storage capacity of the catchment. Due to this relation, catchment runoff is maintained during the whole summer period even under conditions where evapotranspiration exceeds precipitation, while runoff responses to rain events in late summer increase due to increased subsurface hydrological connectivity.\n\nThe elevated polygon rims are covered by living moss and organic soil layers, which constitute fast pathways for shallow subsurface drainage of rainwater due to their high hydraulic conductivities. They convey rainwater along the topographic gradient toward the depressed polygon centres and the troughs and cause a rapid increase in storage water in the centres after rain events. The re-release of this storage water through deeper soil layers with lower hydraulic conductivities is considerably slower.\n\nThe concept of fill-and-spill systems is particularly applicable to polygonal tundra catchments due to their abundant depression storages and their pronounced microtopography. However, soil thaw during summer changes storage capacities and lowers threshold levels for spill processes.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Our results differ from other studies that have concluded near-stream groundwater contributes significantly to streamflow and that its relative contribution increases as drainage from hillslope soils decreases [Dunne and Black, 1970]. In the Archer Creek watershed, streamflow generation and NO3− release are concentrated in hillslope hollows that appear to provide the primary mixing zone for soil water and deeper till groundwater. The watershed has landscape features that are typical of the hydrologically complex Adirondack Mountains. The watershed was glaciated as recently as 10,000–15,000 years ago and therefore has a relatively immature drainage system that is exemplified by several hillslope hollows that contain no stream channels but where water rushing beneath the ground surface was audible. Water appears to flow along the soil-till interface between rocks and boulders that line the hollows. These rocks are overlain by a thin layer of soil, but there is little soil between the rocks at the till surface. We hypothesize that soil water in and near hillslope hollows was mobilized by infiltrating event water and by a rising water table and then rapidly transmitted to the stream along the soil-till interface (Figures 11a–11c). The soil-till interface is typically characterized by an abrupt reduction in hydraulic conductivity in the till. Soil water mixed with deeper till water that flowed into the hollows from upslope groundwater springs or rose into the soils as the water table elevation increased during storms (Figure 11). At the break in slope in the valley bottom this well-mixed soil water and groundwater was transmitted to the stream through rivulets and wetland stream channels during base flow and small storms or across the wetland surface during larger storms when the wetland water table intersected the ground surface. These pathways through the near-stream zone allowed little interaction with wetland groundwater and therefore soil water and till groundwater reached the channel with little chemical alteration [McHale, 1999].

As water enters this region it begins to undergo physical and chemical transformations due to the proximity of the water with the land surface. Evaporation, mineral precipitation, and dissolution cause the water to increase in TDS. Flow paths into the region have both a horizontal and vertical component as depicted with arrows in Figure 8. The presence of evaporite deposits with varying permeabilities causes the flow paths to converge on the TZ shallow region until they reach 1–2 m below ground surface. At this depth, evaporation begins to remove water from the system driving mineral precipitation in the general order of carbonate in the marshes and further salarward additional equilibrium with gypsum and halite is reached, although as demonstrated by the equilibrium geochemical modeling of samples collected seasonally, carbonate equilibrium may be reached across all water types.\n\nThere are a number of discrete flow paths into the TZ shallow zone that discharge at varying rates and locations throughout this area. Some of the water forms springs that discharge at rates greater than the rate at which evaporation can remove the water into the atmosphere. Water does not pool everywhere on the surface in this zone for two reasons: (1) discharge appears to be smaller than the soil evaporation and (2) once water is present at the surface evaporation rates increase substantially resulting in a nonlinear feedback. Because evaporation varies seasonally, some seeps with lower inflow rates are ephemeral and form small lagoons that are seasonally present. The predominant discharge locations occur in the regions up hydraulic gradient of the lagoons. Here the discharge rates are high enough that the rate of discharge greatly exceeds evaporation forming large perennial surface water features which are the lagoons. Even though there are local seeps in and around the margin of lagoons, the majority of water flux into the lagoons appears to be upgradient of the actual surface water feature. Boutt et al. (2016) and Moran et al. (2019) showed that water discharging to these lagoons is a complex mixture of regional groundwater and modern precipitation. The results presented here indicate considerable seasonal variability in the geochemistry of the lagoon waters. Tritium analyses of lagoon waters show that the lagoons at any one time can have up to 30% modern water highlighting the importance of sporadic precipitation events on the hydrologic budget of the lagoons, even though over the long term most of the water is sourced from older regional flow paths (Boutt et al., 2016).', '5', '13', 'Flow Path Evolution', 1, '1', 'N', 'N', 'Geological types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 337, 196, 337, 1, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Combining the observations of the timing of snowmelt and initiation of streamflow, we can begin to construct a conceptual model of the hydrology within the Redondo Peak (Figure 8). Since the sub-surface layers in the upper elevations of the Redondo Peak are typically highly permeable in nature, we can assume that the presence and absence of streamflow in a given channel is closely coupled with the relative position of the water table across the landscape. Conceptually, we can hypothesize a mound of water fluctuating within the highly permeable sub-surface of this resurgent dome (Figure 8). The beginning of observations used in this study coincides with the ending of the 2006 North American Monsoon season. In the southwestern United States this monsoon season occurring in late summer 2006 was one of the wettest on record. This antecedent condition of our observations brings the water table in the Redondo Peak very close to the soil surface across all landscape positions (even at the highest elevations). As a result, more continuous segments of the streams monitored in this study are flowing with water above the soil surface. This is represented by the high percentage of ‘wet’ lengths predicted during late November 2006 (Figure 5). Conceptually, the presence of a water table near the soil surface sustains streamflow (Figure 8(a)). \nMoving forward into the winter season, the Redondo Peak experiences a distinct snow accumulation period. As snow accumulates, the monitored streams in this study are exposed to less light until they reach some (more or less) steady value of exposure (Figure 6). As snow is accumulating over the winter period, there is limited to no water input to the water table in the Redondo Peak. This leads to more discontinuity in sections of the monitored streams that are flowing at the soil surface. The high percentage of ‘wet’ streams begins to decrease for the higher elevation streams and is reflected well in the streams draining through the north to southeast aspects (Streams 1 through 5 in Figure 5). The predicted wetness of the lower elevation streams draining through the south and west of the Redondo Peak not only shows relatively high wetness during this period but also exhibits high variability in wetness. This is likely a combination of rain mixed with snow falling at lower elevations and quick melting occurring on southern and western exposures. \nThe snowmelt season occurs at the Redondo Peak for this study from mid-March to mid-April 2007 (Figures 3 and 7(b)). Snowmelt is, of course, variable in space and time. Elevation appears to exhibit a primary control over the timing of melt (Figure 7(b)) due to temperature gradients rising with elevation. In addition, there is a secondary control of aspect on snowmelt as it occurs earlier and more readily on southern and western aspects of the Redondo Peak (Figures 3 and 6). Coincident to this snowmelt period over the entire Redondo Peak, water infiltrates and raises the water table closer to the soil surface (Figure 8(c)). There is an increase in the percentage of monitored stream lengths predicted as ‘wet’ (Figure 5). This is exemplified in the response of the eastern aspect stream (Stream 3 in Figure 5), but seen in all the streams. Variations in the timing of snowmelt leads to variations in timing of this ‘peak’-predicted wetness for each stream. \nAfter all the snow on the Redondo Peak has melted, the predicted wetness of each stream becomes highly variable through the summer period. Summer is typified by sparse rainfall and rapid growth in vegetation. Thus, evapotranspiration and uptake associated with plant growth tend to draw down the water table in the Redondo Peak. This is similar to the results of Molotch et al. (this issue) and Vivoni et al. (this issue), which indicate that vegetation plays a role in determining the spatial and temporal patterns in soil moisture across the landscape. This is counteracted by sporadic recharge from rainfall over the summer season. Since summer storms are localized in the VCNP, the relation between landscape ‘wetness’ and streamflow is relatively weaker during the monsoon as compared to the winter and spring seasons (Vivoni et al., this issue). In our conceptual model, this period is best represented by a highly variable position of the water table (Figure 8(d)). This fluctuation in the percentage length of streams flowing in headwater positions demonstrates the tight coupling between streams (or surface water) and the landscape (or groundwater) in this system. Towards the end of the summer (and, coincidently, the end of the period of observation), we begin to see a general trend of increase in the percentage length of stream predicted as ‘wet’ (Figure 5). This corresponds, again, to the late summer North American Monsoon as we cycle through the year. In addition, the length of days begins to shorten, leading to decreased plant activity across the Redondo Peak and lower evapotranspiration rates. \nObviously, this simplistic conceptual model merely provides a first-cut of the myriad of hydrologic processes occurring within the Redondo Peak. For example, Stream 8, a mid-elevation stream draining through a west–northwestern aspect, shows limited or no response in predicted wetness throughout the sampling period. This could indicate that this stream is being fed by deeper groundwater sources than those represented in our conceptual model (e.g. geothermal upwelling or springs). Such inference could be clarified using the composition of chemical components (i.e. stable water isotopes) present in this stream to determine the relative ‘age’ of the water. That is, is the water sampled in Stream 8 more similar to rainfall or shallow ground water or more similar to water sampled from deep groundwater wells with respect to chemical composition? This indicates a need for year-round sampling to determine the sources and ecohydrological controls on the water in streams draining the Redondo Peak.

In fact, neither geophysical surveys nor on-site trenches (up to 3 m deep) were able to reach the water-table level in the meta-sedimentary region of AEB, leading to the assumption of hydraulic disconnection between surface and groundwater flow (Costa et al., 2013).\nRainfall and runoff at the AEB\nThe increasing runoff coefficient on the downstream direction (i) follows an increase on the average annual rainfall (490, 570 and 650 mm from 2005 to 2014 in the AEB, Malhada and Iguatu catchments, respectively); (ii) follows an increase on the vegetation degradation; and (iii) may also indicate that the water infiltrated on the headwaters return as surface flow. […]\nAmong the main reasons for the low runoff coefficient at AEB, there are high potential evapotranspiration rates (fivefold the precipitation annually), high infiltration rates associated with deep water table and vegetation interception. In fact, Medeiros et al. (2009), studying the Caatinga in the AEB in the period 2004–2008, concluded that 12% of the rainfall (26 times the runoff) consisted of forest interception losses, caused mainly by the high evaporation rate, despite the vegetation low canopy-trunk storage capacity (0.58 mm). For the events with precipitation above 10 mm, interception losses account for 11% on average, with coefficient of variation of 0.7. During the wet period, monthly interception losses range from 2 to 20 mm in May and February, respectively, whereas in the dry season total rainfall is negligible.\nRunoff under different geological constraints\nThe results have shown different hydrological responses for sub-catchments under distinct geological constraints. For the prevailing sedimentary sub-catchment (SSC, 9 km2, with gauging station EF1 in its outlet, Figure 1), infiltration is a key variable because of the existing deep permeable alluvium. For the prevailing crystalline sub-catchment (CSC, 2 km2, whose outlet is controlled by gauging station EF2, Figure 1), soils have a lateritic impediment layer at the depth of 1 m – 2 m.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Our results indicate that contemporary run-off generation in the studied subwatersheds is primarily associated with infiltration excess overland flow, not saturation excess overland flow or baseflow from a shallow water table (Figure 9a). Multiple strands of evidence point to this finding.\n\nFirst, there was clear evidence that overland flow occurred during run-off-producing storms. The flow trap observations detected such flow during all run-off-producing storms in nearly all of the flow traps. The isotope analysis suggested that run-off was composed of new water, rather than containing signals of old water consisting of soil or groundwater. We visually observed overland flows during rainfall events in the study watersheds and saw clear evidence of erosion as flowlines, a precursor to rill formation (Merritt, 1984). The sites where we made these observations were topographically flat, distributed throughout the watershed, and suggest that overland flow generation during storms is widely distributed, rather than being confined to particular topographic positions or land cover types. Simultaneously, we did not observe any evidence of a shallow water table and noted a downward propagation of wetting fronts into a drier subsoil during storm events. These observations are inconsistent with contemporary flow production from a shallow or perched water table and suggest that overland flow is the primary watershed-scale mode of run-off response.\n\nSecond, a number of strands of evidence suggest that infiltration excess, rather than saturation excess, is likely the dominant mechanism generating the observed overland flow. The observed saturated hydraulic conductivities in soils were relatively low, and observed rainfall intensities exceeded these conductivities for 25% or more of the storms that occurred. The observation of a downward propagating wetting front throughout the storm, and indeed, increasing soil saturation well after surface run-off peaks had been generated is also consistent with the occurrence of infiltration excess run-off. Typically, at least a fraction of the observed soil columns remained unsaturated during run-off producing events, again consistent with infiltration excess, but not saturation excess, streamflow generation mechanisms. The insensitivity of run-off probability to soil moisture is also consistent with this mechanism. The only finding we made that was inconsistent (or at least inconclusive) with respect to infiltration excess run-off generation was the absence of a clear threshold in storm intensity around which run-off did or did not occur. We hypothesize that this is likely to be associated with heterogeneity in rainfall intensity across the studied subwatersheds and potentially also to heterogeneity in water storage in check dams, which fragment the channel network and may obscure the relationship between generation of run-off at field scales and propagation of run-off to the tank at the watershed outlet.', '4.1', '1989', 'Contemporary streamflow generation', 1, '1', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 340, 229, 340, 1, 2, 2),

Both intensity dependent and wetness dependent thresholds were identified in the runoff response. During wet conditions, hydrological connectivity has a strong influence on water delivery to the riparian area. Saturation excess runoff from the riparian zone was also important. The results of this study demonstrated the following. 1. Runoff generation in most events is dependent on the catchment connectivity and soil moisture conditions. When the sum of the antecedent soil water storage and event rainfall exceeded 250 mm, runoff was typically produced by a mix of saturation excess and subsurface storm flow. Under these conditions, a water table forms in the soil and a saturated area develops in the riparian zone. When the water level rises to within about 1 m of the surface at mid-slope sites, rapid subsurface flow pathways are activated which connected the mid-slope and riparian area, contributing event flow to the flume at the catchment outlet. 2. When the catchment became very wet, high water levels persisted at the mid-slope sites, which remained hydrologically connected to the riparian area, and baseflow became persistent between events. 3. High rainfall intensity events produced runoff even when the antecedent soil water storage (ASI) plus event rainfall depth was below the 250 mm threshold.

Quebrada Grande, as other humid tropical headwater catchments, was characterized by a fast runoff response (also known as wave celerity; McDonnell & Beven, 2014), which turns in, prompt solute transport (~1.25 hr; Figure 2d), reaching a DOC maximum near 8 mg C/L (Figure 4c). \nThis flushing hypothesis (Mei et al., 2014) explains the first-order mechanism of DOC transport at Quebrada Grande. Organic solutes are leached from near-surface horizons by a rising water table (~80-cm depth) followed by a rapid lateral transport of these materials to the stream via saturation excess runoff in the riparian areas, soils saturated throughout the catchment, and shallow groundwater discharge similar to another forested and steep mountainous catchment in northern Costa Rica as described by Dehaspe et al.

The latter explained the high DOC concentrations measured during large storm events (Figure 4). DOC during baseflow exhibited large variations as a result of a potential low biogeochemical attenuation since water logging sustained soil temperature nearly constant at 16°C (Figure 3d).

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Overall, the Pallas catchment streamflow shows fast responses (<1 h) to precipitation events (Figure 3), indicating rather limited dynamic storage in the catchment. Stream hydrographs are flashy, indicating rapid responses to rainfall events, limited soil storage, and active surface runoff generation from landscape units. […] Compared to local annual precipitation amounts of 647 mm, mean short-term aquifer volume (STS) values as low as 14 mm support limited catchment storage in Pallas. […] Based on these analyses, 69 ± 9% of streamflow during the snowy season originates from rainfall and 31 ± 9% from snowfall. During the rainy season, 70 ± 9% of streamflow comes from rainfall and 30 ± 9% from snowfall, which is similar to the snowy season. […] Annual ET derives almost equally from snowy season precipitation (48 ± 7%) and rainy season precipitation (52 ± 7%). Similar trends are also evident in the dual-isotope plot (Figure 2). For example, the stream data for spring and early summer 2014 show relatively low δ18O values during peak flow from snowmelt, followed by a rapid increase from −15.5‰ to −12‰ coincident with a large rainfall event (Figure 3(c)), and indicative of limited STS catchment storage capacity and an extensive network of rapid surface flow paths. Indeed, the Pallas hillslope is dominated by till with declining hydraulic conductivity to a depth of 30 cm, thus promoting overland strong flow formation as seen in stream discharge and isotopic data. Additionally, shallow soil structures maintain only limited soil and groundwater storage. […] \nSubsurface soil was fully saturated during the snowmelt runoff period, but moisture content declined markedly afterward (data not shown), indicating that the majority of snowmelt inputs produce runoff or generate groundwater recharge. In contrast, only large summer precipitation events (>20 mm) increased soil moisture content, indicating that summer precipitation either evapotranspired or produced direct runoff through preferential flow. Following larger rainfall events, catchment soils drain quickly (within days), indicating that soils in the upper hills do not store moisture between precipitation events. Soil moisture measurements indicate that the upper layer (top 5 cm) responds more quickly than lower layers (30 cm) to snowmelt or rainfall inputs, demonstrating flow through the till layers'' (cf. Bishop et al., 2011), and enabling quick flow along with the upper more permeable soil layer in the forest areas. These observations are further supported by the minimal lag (within minutes) between rainfall events and water level rise in peatland piezometers, as well as the simultaneous increase in stream discharge due to rapid rainfall runoff from the hills and peatlands directly into the stream. Hence, these data further support that Pallas catchment storage is limited by the relatively shallow, young soil deposit layers. \n[…] Interestingly, although snowmelt contributes more than one-third of the catchment water input, meltwater isotope values only shift temporarily during the main spring flood peak towards snow isotope values. These data suggest that there is minimal dynamic snowmelt water storage in the catchment, due to highly permeable flow paths through the top peat layer (especially at the fen site), facilitating ephemeral snowmelt water presence in the stream. Short storage during snowmelt is further supported by the observation that the stream water isotope values exhibit only a short period of depletion (i.e., snow-like) and then within weeks become enriched and much more similar to those of GW. Relatively modest, short-lived responses of stream isotope values to snowmelt have been observed previously in other snow-influenced catchments with peat soils (Ala-aho et al., 2018; Tetzlaff et al., 2018). However, the overall isotope values in the stream, groundwater, and springs are depleted relative to precipitation, and gravitate towards depleted snowmelt isotope values (Figure 2), suggesting a dominant role of snowmelt in recharging groundwater reservoirs, as seen globally (Jasechko et al., 2014).\n', '3.2', '9', 'Limited catchment dynamic storage controls hydrological responses', 1, '3', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 343, 167, 343, 1, 1, 2),

This acts to convey water directly to the slope-foot floodplain area and sustain high soil moisture, offsetting the differential effects of forest transpiration and the excess runoff losses as a result of forest clearance. In this model, the cleared plots are seen as ''windows'' in a system which is dominated by subsurface water movement and is somewhat insensitive, at least in soil moisture flux terms, to the type of clearance treatment. Detailed analysis of the soil- water fluxes will be needed to evaluate this hypothesis and especially the relative importance of differences in treatment and differences in subsurface conditions and these will be published later.

On average, the runoff coefficient is extremely low (below 0.5%), with specific discharge of approximately 2 mm per annum.\nStatistically, the most relevant hydrological variables concerning runoff (mm) were the maximum 60-min intensity (I60), the maximum 120-min intensity (I120) and total precipitation, whereas average intensity and antecedent soil moisture presented marginal influence.\nThe most important variables to explain runoff initiation in the basin were the total precipitation and I60. It is noteworthy that the temporal constraint (60 min) is equivalent to the concentration time of the basin; and that the I60 threshold value (12 mm h−1) is approximately the river bank saturated hydraulic conductivity. These results corroborate the hypothesis of Medeiros et al. (2010) that the Hortonian-type runoff prevails in this environment.\nThe joint analysis of the intensity threshold value and the hydraulic conductivity at the basin shows that the river bank is the compartment where connectivity is more intensively broken, because of high infiltration potential associated with deep percolation.\nThe best-performance explanation of runoff initiation based on classical hydrological variables, (rainfall magnitude, intensities and duration; and soil moisture) could not explain over a quarter of the events, inducing that there might be other relevant processes to be tackled. A possible explanation, which demands further investigation, is that initial abstractions change seasonably (Costa et al., 2013) as a function of the dynamic behaviour of the root system in the Caatinga biome (Pinheiro et al., 2013). The tree roots shrink during dry periods, enhancing macro-pore flow and thus initial abstractions. As a result, runoff initiation probability decays. Macro-pore flow has proven to be a relevant variable, especially in semi-arid zone (van Schaik et al., 2014); however, it has been attributed to soil cracking (Worrall et al., 2007; Tian et al., 2012), not to root dynamics.\n', 'N/A', '2399', 'Conclusions', 1, '2', 'Vegetation types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'Unknown items identified', 'Impact of root activity described', 352, 6, 352, 1, 1, 2),

The low drainage density of the catchment, characteristic of permeable soils and high-vegetation cover, fits with the result that overland flow is contributed by at most 4% of the catchment, even during storms as large as 100 mm of rain. The average minimum contributing area over the full study period was equivalent to only 2.8% of the catchment. This corresponds to an area of little more than the channel floodplain and provides convincing evidence that overland flow may rarely be widespread in the catchmerit. Most of the storm flow runoff is probably generated as direct channel precipitation during the frequent small storms and as saturation overland flow from valley bottom areas immediately adjacent to the stream channel during the larger storms.\n\nThe present study also provides an evaluation of the importance of storm flow runoff to the total export of water from the basin, which can be directly related to the storm size and frequency \ncharacteristics of rainfall that were previously published by Lesack and Melack [1991].

The fast raising of GW levels, combined with geomorphological and pedological information, suggests that the infiltration of waters occurs principally through preferential infiltration zones. The analysis of stable H and O isotopes allowed to specify that Precambrian basement aquifers of the semi-arid region of Ceará are mainly recharged by meteoric waters through indirect infiltration from evaporated surface water.

In consequence, hydrodynamic and hydrogeochemical data suggest that crystalline basement aquifers are rapidly recharged by evaporated surface waters through preferential infiltration zones (i.e. low points of the relief). The seasonal variability of the GW isotopic composition presupposes that the mixing proportion between direct and indirect infiltration varies over the year, once again emphasising the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of these processes.

Since 2005 the large  volume of water stored in the Riacho Verde reservoir (RV  in  FIG.  1)  has  made  it  possible  to  release  water  into  the   Forquilha river during the dry season, making it perennial  down to the end of Section 2 (FIG. 2).\n\nThe increase in salinity after the floods of 2004 may be accounted for by either contribution from the crystalline bedrock or leaching from the unsaturated zone. The difference in salt mass between pre-flood baseline values (t0) and values 27 and 90 days after the flood (t27 and t90) measured at the three piezometers makes it possible to calculate the amount of salt required to produce the observed increase (TAB. 3; FIG. 6). The balance was carried out to test the hypothesis that salinity increased after the flood of 2004 due to the leaching of salts accumulated by evaporation in the unsaturated zone since the previous peak flood. The salinity of the groundwater near the river decreased due to dilution by direct infiltration of low-salinity (0.07 g L-1) runoff water along the river bed; that is the case of P101. On the contrary, the groundwater salinity farther from the aquifer (P111 and P113) increased considerably due to the leaching of 1 to 2 kg m-2 of salts (compare M values pre/post-flood in TAB. 3) from the unsaturated zone (hypothesis 1) or due to the discharge of saline water through crevices in the bedrock (hypothesis 2, FIG. 6). When the level of the river falls, the river-to-aquifer flow is reverted allowing saline water to drain into the river, explaining the salinity peak observed at P101. Ninety days after the flood, when the water level of the river and the aquifer was nearly the same, the salinity was similar at P101 and P111, but still differed at P113 due to the greater distance from the river. In an earlier study of the soils in this area (2002), a drainage test yielded a salt concentration of 3 g L-1 in leached water. This is even higher than the concentration considered in the present study (1.52 and 2.04 g L-1).\n', 'N/A', '636 & 641', 'Materials and methods & Salt mass balance', 1, '2', 'N', 'N', 'Bedrock described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'salinity study', 355, 71, 355, 1, 3, 2),

In Western Bahia, the long-term average precipitation was 1060 mm/year, between 1980 and 2015. During the dry season (June, July, August) the precipitation varies from 0 to 10 mm/month, and in the rainy season (December, January, February), 150–200 mm/month (Pousa et al., 2019). The percolation from precipitation is the major source of groundwater recharge for the UAS. The rainy season occurs between the months of November and April, and it represents an accumulated average of 1200 mm/year. Rainfall events happen both in intense and short-term occurrences. After these events, some water leaves system by surface runoff into rivers and streams, and by evapotranspiration.

The dilution observed during rainfall events, shows that the generated hydrograph is dependent on not only surface flow, but also subsurface flow. The relationship between liquid discharge and concentration of dissolved chemicals makes it possible to further understand the hydrology of the catchment (Evans and Davies, 1998, Lloyd et al., 2016, Williams et al., 2018), considering that their relation can generate different patterns that are influenced by the climate and topography of the study site (Maher, 2011).\n\nThe six monitored events indicate that the dynamics of the origin of flows that occur in spring and summer are significantly different from those that occur in autumn and winter. Due to rainfall pattern, the predominant effect or process during autumn and winter events appears to be the “piston effect” or ”translation“ (Pearce et al., 1986, Renée Brooks et al., 2010). Translation takes place because precipitation is less intense and lengthy, resulting in larger moisture in the soil, influenced by the low evaporative demand in this period, thus allowing water input and consequently occupation of the porous space. However, the translation process expels water that has been already stored (old water), making this water flow towards the river channel. The new rainfall event water infiltrates and fills the pores by pushing the old water out. Then, the probability that the soil infiltration capacity is exceeded is simply much smaller because in the autumn and winter the rain intensity is lower, and less Hortanian overland flow will occur.\n\nIn spring and summer, the heavy rains generally do not saturate the soil profile, thus part of the water flow runs quickly through the soil surface, and probably the infiltrated portion generates a slower subsurface flow, which creates a second peak in the hydrograph. In this case, the greatest contribution of rainwater (new water) prevails in relation to old water. \n', '9', '4.1', 'Hydrological analysis of the catchment', 1, '2', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 357, 120, 357, 1, 1, 2),

The correlation was found to be so strong that the fraction of the catchment accounting for stormflow runoff could be calculated. For both catchments this area was found to coincide with the extent of the riparian wetland and never exceeded 0Ð6%, even for the largest storms. Clearly, the storm response of these catchments is generated by direct runoff from the saturated source areas. These source areas do not vary over time and, in this, the catchments show a storm response that differs from the variable source area runoff found in catchments in moderate climates\n\nThe suggestion that all rainfall outside the riparian valley infiltrates and does not reach the stream channel to contribute to stormflow was supported by infiltration measurements and the strong correlation between ground-water levels and baseflow. It seems that the observed response of these catchments is mainly forced by the high permeability of the soils and possibly by secondary per-meability along the deep root system of the secondary vegetation.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Bofedales contribute to catchment wide water storage and sustain baseflow through three mechanisms (Fig. 8). First, bofedales form in low gradient, glacially carved landscapes. Upland bofedales form in cirques, in which lakes or ponds become peat-forming through a process of terrestrialization. Bofedales are thus located in interior basins that, in the URW, are 4 − 12 times greater than the bofedal itself. Thus, bofedales intercept large volumes of groundwater, which leads to seasonal saturation. Second, layers of high porosity peat (with high drainable porosity) form a natural sponge to seasonally store tremendous volumes of water. Third, the combined effects of a low water table gradient and low hydraulic conductivities in underlying clay and mineral layers, result in the slow release of water from bofedales to streams. Although our study is the first to quantify the hydrology of bofedales in the context of water resources in the humid puna, previous studies have shown water flowing through wetlands to have longer mean transit times (e.g., Lyon et al., 2010; Roa-García and Weiler, 2010; Buytaert et al., 2011; Lane et al., 2020; Lazo et al., 2019) and argued the presence of wetlands increases or dominates the existing catchment wide water storage (e.g., Lane et al., 2020). The impact of bofedal groundwater dynamics on streamflow is best illustrated through the three phases: ‘fill-up,’ ‘steady-state,’ and ‘release.’ In the fill-up phase, precipitation recharges the unsaturated zone to field capacity as the water table in bofedales continues to fall to nearly 2 m below the ground surface. After an average of 138 mm of precipitation, field capacity is reached in the upland rooting zone, causing drainage, and groundwater inflow to the bofedales. Bofedales saturate at the beginning of the steady-state phase. At this point, seasonally dynamic water storage in the URW has approached the storage capacity, and runoff rapidly increases as the catchment sheds additional precipitation. We note the likelihood of saturation overland flow across bofedales during the steady-state phase. The end of the rainy season in May – June marks the start of the release phase. Groundwater from hillslopes continues to move through bofedales to streams at rates sufficient to maintain saturation in the bofedales until an average of 41 days into the dry season, at which point the water table begins to fall at an average rate of 14 mm/day. Additional moisture depletion in the peat and clay below field capacity occurs due to transpiration of deeply rooted hydrophytic plants.', '4.5', '15', 'Conceptual model of bofedal hydrology', 2, '4', 'N', 'Multiple properties described', 'N', 'Topography described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 359, 243, 359, 2, 5, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Stream discharge partitioned into stormflow and baseflow shows how groundwater dominates the total flow of Augusta Creek; baseflow averaged 78% of the total discharge (Figure 3b). There is no linear trend in total (p = .14), stormflow (p = .91), or baseflow (p = .83) discharge over the 50 years. In this catchment, stormflow likely reflects mainly precipitation falling on lakes and wetlands that are contiguous with the stream channels because upland soils are highly permeable and there are few impervious surfaces and little overland runoff from uplands to the streams. This is supported by the comparison of annual stormflow volumes to the annual precipitation falling on contiguous lakes and wetlands: on average, stormflow amounts to 57% (range, 44–73%) of the precipitation with no linear trend over the 50 years (p = .09, data not shown). The balance, which equates to a mean of 408 mm year−1, could largely be explained by evapotranspirative losses from the lakes and wetlands. If stormflow originating as overland flow from the uplands were important, the total stormflow volume would exceed the precipitation on lakes and wetlands.\nOur annual water balances for Augusta Creek resemble earlier estimates calculated by Rheaume (1990) over three representative years (1971, 1977, and 1985), which indicated that 62%, 65%, and 59%, respectively, of the annual precipitation was returned to the atmosphere as ET, mainly during the growing season (May–September), although those estimates included ET from contiguous lakes and wetlands as well as uplands.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The Jornada Basin has a mean annual rainfall of 247 mm (Wainwright, in press), which accumulates in two distinct seasons. In winter, frontal storms originating in the northern Pacific bring low intensity rainfall that may last for several days but generally results in little runoff. In summer, monsoonal airflow from the Gulf of Mexico provides the moisture input for convective thunderstorms. These thunderstorms are characterized by high rainfall rates, short durations, and small areal extents, and are responsible for about 60% of the annual rainfall and virtually all of the runoff.\nThe main runoff process on semiarid hillslopes, such as those found in the Jornada Basin, is Horton overland flow (Horton, 1933). This type of overland flow occurs when the rainfall rate exceeds the infiltration rate. The infiltration excess is initially stored in small surface depressions, but once these depressions are filled, it begins to flow downhill. Overland flow is hydraulically very complex. Flow depths and velocities are highly variable over space due to microtopography (Dunne et al., 1991) and the presence of stones and vegetation Emmett, 1970, Emmett, 1978. Over small areas, overland flow may be laminar, turbulent, transitional, or may consist of patches of any of these three flow states (Abrahams et al., 1990).\nA principal consequence of the transition from grassland to shrubland is a significant change in the nature of overland flow. On grassland hillslopes, overland flow is dispersed; resistance to flow is high; and flow velocities are low (Abrahams et al., 1994). On shrubland hillslopes, overland flow tends to be more concentrated in character. Most shrubs reside on microtopographic mounds a few centimeters high, which cause overland flow in the bare intershrub areas to concentrate in flow paths that diverge and converge around the shrubs in a complex reticular pattern. These flow concentrations have greater flow velocities and are more erosive than comparable discharges on grassland hillslopes.\nThe development of shrub mounds is attributed to a number of abiotic and biotic processes (Schlesinger and Pilmanis, 1998). Abiotic processes include the deposition of fine clastic material by wind and differential rainsplash. Differential rainsplash Carson and Kirkby, 1972, Parsons et al., 1992 refers to the tendency for more sediment to be splashed from intershrub to shrub areas than in the reverse direction because raindrop energy is dissipated by shrub canopies. In shrubland areas that were formerly grassland, the surface (A-) horizon of the grassland soil has been eroded in the intershrub areas, but remnants persist under the larger shrubs. Thus, the mounds under these shrubs are partly erosional and partly depositional Parsons et al., 1992, Abrahams et al., 1995. Biotic processes include uptake and subsequent recycling of nutrients through the deposition of litter in the area beneath the shrub, digging by rodents (which enhances infiltration) and the funneling of intercepted rainfall to the base of the shrub by stemflow. Since these processes tend to concentrate water and nutrients beneath the shrub canopies, the shrub mounds tend to correspond to “islands of fertility” (Schlesinger et al., 1990) or “resource islands” (Reynolds et al., 1999).\nStudies concerned with the supply of water to shrubs tend to focus on the role of interception and stemflow (e.g., Navar and Bryan, 1990, Martinez-Meza and Whitford, 1996, Abrahams et al., manuscript in preparation). Furthermore, plant growth models developed by Reynolds et al. (1997) to simulate the evolution of shrubland ecosytems are based on the assumption that all of the water reaching a shrub originates as rain falling directly onto the shrub. The lateral redistribution of water by overland flow from areas of runoff to areas of runon is widely recognized as being critical to plant production of desert ecosystems Schlesinger and Jones, 1984, Noy-Meir, 1985.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'This paper analyzed the dynamics of soil moisture and its role in rainfall-runoff processes based on the field data of precipitation, discharge, and soil moisture in a post-seismic mountainous catchment in southwest China. Both the soil properties and the observed soil moisture dynamics indicated soil stratification at a depth between 30 cm and 50 cm, which is the interface between the leaching layer and the illuvial horizon. The correlation analysis also helped visualize the linkage between soil depths, indicating the vertical infiltration activity within the soil volume. The correlation of temporal variability between different soil depths was disrupted at the interface. Drastic decrease and anisotropy of saturated hydraulic conductivity were observed at soil depths above the interface, which led to larger temporal variability, a higher frequency of preferential flow occurrence and a transient perched water table in the upper soil depths. Furthermore, vertical infiltration was dominant in the lower soil depths. The impacts of stratification were more significant at the upper hillslope site (HS), where the steep topographic gradient further facilitated lateral subsurface flow generation in the upper soil depths. At the lower hillslope site (GND), with little impacts from the topographic gradient, the local soil water movement was complicated by the incoming subsurface flow as well as the lateral water channels developed by the abundant root residues.\n\nThese dynamics in soil moisture further influenced runoff generation on total discharge as well as the timing of flood peak. Different from the linear correlation between rainfall and soil moisture response, there was a threshold response for runoff generation at the event scale. The total rainfall had to be larger than 50 mm to saturate the upper soil layers to develop a transient perched water table before a quick rise in discharge was observed. At the HS site, the upper soil layers (<50 cm) were the more dominant contributor in preferential flow and runoff generation, the contribution dropped drastically at lower soil layers. While at the GND site, all the soil depths contributed to the rainfall-runoff process, their contribution declined gradually with depth.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The upper third of the catchment has an undulating plateau relief with slopes up to 7%. The middle and lower third of the catchment have a much steeper topography with slope gradients often exceeding 15%. The fields naturally have a high connectivity with the natural channels as there is no depositional area between the channel and the sloping land. Moreover, riparian areas are not well protected by natural forests, facilitating the transfer of water and sediment from the hillslope to the river channel. The unpaved roads also play an important role in the water dynamics of the catchment. They are directly connected to the catchment drainage network and have an impervious surface, therefore they generate large amounts of surface runoff as well as of sediment (Minella et al., 2009). The high connectivity accelerates water and sediment discharge to the river channel, opportunities for sediment storage within the catchment are limited. The climate is classified as Cfb (subtropical super-humid with no dry season and warm summer) according to Köppen (Alvares et al., 2013). The average annual rainfall is ca. 1938 mm and the erosivity index (EI30) is 9344 MJ mm ha−1h−1 yr−1 (Ramon, 2017). The rain is well distributed throughout the year. However, runoff occurs more often during spring due to high rainfall intensities.\nThe soil types in the catchment are classified as Acrisols, Cambisols and Leptosols according to a detailed soil classification survey (1:5000) that was carried out in accordance to the guidelines of the (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006) (Fig. 2a). The Acrisols are mainly located in the upper portion of the catchment. They are characterized by an abrupt texture change between the A horizon and the argic B horizon, which may potentially lead to water stagnation on top of the B horizon. The Leptosols are found in the lower portion of the catchment, where the relief is steep and characterized by the absence of a subsurface horizon where the surface horizon is in direct contact with the rock, thus affecting water flux in the deeper layers. Where Leptosols are present, there are often coarse materials such as boulders and gravel at the surface. Cambisols locally appear in areas dominated by Acrisols and/or Leptosols. Soil drainage is classified as being moderate to good (de Barros, 2012, Dalbianco, 2013). However, on gentle slopes the soil may remain saturated for several days after a rainfall event. [...] The dilution observed during rainfall events, shows that the generated hydrograph is dependent on not only surface flow, but also subsurface flow.

Translation takes place because precipitation is less intense and lengthy, resulting in larger moisture in the soil, influenced by the low evaporative demand in this period, thus allowing water input and consequently occupation of the porous space. However, the translation process expels water that has been already stored (old water), making this water flow towards the river channel.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Indeed the MDV are quite dry, with annual water equivalent precipitation, which is dominated by snow, in the valley bottoms of 2–50 mm (Fountain et al. 2010), most of which sublimates prior to melting (Chinn 1993).  […] Snow patches accumulated on the valley floors are composed of direct precipitation and drifting snow, which can accumulate in any wind-sheltered location, such as behind boulders and within stream channels.  [...] Sublimation is the most significant process ablating snow on the valley floors. On valley walls, nivation hollows (small depressions that occur and persist due to snow patch accumulation, frost weathering, melt water erosion, and subsequent gelifluction) that collect snow often provide substantial melt that flows down the walls in narrow streaks (Levy et al. 2008). [...] Numerous glaciers reach the valley bottom where total energy balance (including warm summer temperatures) is sufficient to melt surface ice. Melt water runoff creates ephemeral streams that flow to perennially ice-covered lakes. Stream flow is quite flashy because the ice temperature at the glacier surface is typically at the cusp of melting during the austral summer, such that only small changes in the energy balance at the ice surface turn water flow on or off (Hoffman et al. 2008; Lewis et al. 1998). Indeed, a thin layer of new snow only a few cm thick can terminate meltwater production due to the increased albedo of the ice surface. This new snow layer can persist for days to weeks due to the little sensible heat in the atmosphere. Runoff differs for each glacier, not from glacier surface area, but mostly in response to surface conditions that alter the energy balance. Therefore, runoff generation is strongly affected by valley position (i.e. solar radiation, winds, air temperature, and snowfall) of source glaciers and by surface roughness that alters turbulent heat exchange with the atmosphere. [...] The MDV landscape is completely underlain by thick permafrost (>100 m), but at the surface, active layer soils thaw during the austral summer to depths of 60–70 cm [...] With no rain and little snowmelt, soils across the MDV are generally dry, except where sustained sources of liquid water are present. Soils that border streams and lakes are locations of consistent wetness during the austral summer. Water moves from the water bodies into the soil and gets wicked away from the shoreline or stream edge due to capillary suction [...] Streams of the MDV provide a critical linkage between glaciers and lakes, and deliver substantial water to soils and sediments along the stream corridor. Stream channels are stable and well-defined, ranging in length from <1 km to over 24 km. However, melt water flows in streams for only 8–12 weeks per year, when surface energy balance on MDV glaciers is great enough to produce melt water [...] Even on a daily time scale streamflow is variable because the greatest amount of melt is generated when the sun shines directly on the glacier faces, causing a melt pulse that moves down the stream [...] Hyporheic zones represent an important control on stream flow during ‘low flow’ summers (i.e. those with low glacial melt water production) because they are essentially porous ‘sponge reservoirs’ making up streambeds that must be filled before water can flow downstream. [...] When liquid water is available in streams and/or hyporheic zones, there is a consistent link to the atmosphere through evaporation. Gooseff et al. (2003b) observed evaporation rates on the order of 6 mm/day from direct measurements in a short-term pan experiment [...] Most lakes in the MDV are closed basins. All inflow is via surface streams and some component of subsurface melt and the only outlet is through evaporation of free water in the summer months, and sublimation of the ice cover year-round. All lakes of the MDV also have perennial ice covers. For most, during the summer months a ‘moat’ opens in the shallow shore region of the lake to allow stream flow to get under the ice cover and reach hydrostatic equilibrium.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Our steep, volcanic study site on permeable Andisols in northeastern Costa Rica fell in the above category of dominant sub-surface flow pathways, albeit slightly shallower compared to Muñoz-Villers and McDonnell (2012) (on average 44% of shallow soil water and 22% throughfall contributions to the main stream), which according to the meta-analysis of Barthold and Woods (2015) prevails in the tropics. Even though rainfall intensities (>40 mm/h) can be extreme in San Lorencito, the measured infiltration capacities (>100 mm/h) always exceed the physically probable maximum rainfall intensity, and Horton infiltration excess overland flow can be safely excluded as a likely surface runoff generation mechanism. Nonetheless, Solano-Rivera et al. (2019) identified a hillslope-stream connectivity in the most extreme rainfall events as evidenced by soil erosion and transport of materials to the stream, which indicates that some version of saturated conditions and overland flow may occur. The most obvious mechanism of such a surface flow path is saturation excess runoff. The mixing model results presented here do not directly support a saturation excess runoff generation mechanism and we preferred to refer to dominant near-surface flow pathways similar to Tetzlaff et al. (2014). Generally, the soil physical characteristics play a crucial role in determining the dominant runoff generation mechanisms and flow pathways even under undisturbed forest cover and independent of terrain slope in the tropics, as recently pointed out by Wymore et al. (2017), reviewed earlier by Elsenbeer (2001) and critically appraised by Bruijnzeel (2004). Our spatial comparison between the sub-catchment tributaries A and B supports the soil control on near-surface runoff generation in pristine rainforests, which according to Zimmermann et al. (2012) is likely a much more widespread phenomenon than previously thought (Sidle et al., 2006). We found a quicker and shallower near-surface runoff generation in the steeper and more coarse-grained soils of the southern sub-catchment tributary B, without indication of much deeper soil end-member contribution, as opposed to the less steep northern tributary A with a more significant deeper soil end-member contribution to streamflow.\n\n[...] Similarly, we used a few tritium low flow measurements at San Lorencito to gain understanding of the range of baseflow ages. We did not find evidence for old groundwater at low flows. Despite being a perennial stream with a mean discharge of around 0.3 m3/s, the San Lorencito discharge decreases significantly over a few weeks of low rainfall to less than 50 L/s (absolute observed minimum 20 L/s in April 2016). This is in contrast to tropical Andean catchments that maintain a high low flow volume at the end of the dry season due to significant groundwater storage and lateral connectivity (Clark et al., 2014). The tritium analysis was applied as a complementary tracer to generate a more complete picture of the suite of flow pathways and runoff components composing streamflow at high, medium and low flows in line with Farrick and Branfireun (2015). Again, the combination of different tracers with hydrometric approaches and tracer-aided modelling (Correa et al., 2020; Dehaspe et al., 2018) showed that runoff generation and flow pathways composing the San Lorencito streamflow originates in the first 50 cm of soil, with the bulk of water being generated in the first 15 cm of soil (shallow layer).', '4.1', '11', 'Dominant flowpaths and runoff generation in tropical rainforest catchments', 2, '1', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 366, 201, 366, 11, 2, 2),

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The HOAL is special in that many runoff generation mechanisms can be observed simultaneously in different parts of the catchment (Fig. 5). Due to shallow, low permeable soils and the use of the catchment area as agricultural land, the concave part of the catchment was tile drained in the 1940s in an effort to reduce water logging. The estimated drainage area from the tile drains is about 15 % of the total catchment and can be divided into two bigger systems in the south-western part of the catchment and four smaller drainage systems in the north-eastern part. The pipes drain into the main stream at four locations. Two tile drain systems (Sys1, Sys2) do not dry out during the year, while two are ephemeral (Frau1, Frau2) (see Fig. 7). The uppermost 25 % of the stream was piped in the 1940s to enlarge the agricultural production area. The pipe enters the main stream at inlet Sys4. Its flow dynamics and chemistry are similar to those of the permanent tile drains as it drains the surrounding soil. There are two clearly visible springs that directly discharge into the stream. These are Q1 and K1. The water from Q1 originates from a fractured siltstone aquifer with distinct hydrologic and chemical characteristic from those of other point sources along the stream. The hydrologic dynamics and chemical characteristics of K1 are more similar to the perennial tile drainages. Q1 is perennial, while K1 is not. In the south-eastern part of the catchment is a small wetland close to the stream which permanently seeps into the stream via two rivulets (A1, A2). The wetland is fed by springs at the upper part of the wetland and usually responds very quickly to all types of rainfall due to its high saturation state. During low-intensity events in summer, the flow in the main stream responds to rainfall with substantial delay as the soil usually offers a lot of storage capacity, depending on soil moisture. A mixture of tile drainage water, diffusive inflow from the shallow aquifer, spring water, and surface water from the wetland tends to feed the stream. During major storms, saturation overland flow occurs across the fields (mainly in the depression areas along the thalweg and close to the stream) which enters the stream at two (E1, E2) or three locations, depending on the magnitude of the event. The overland flow causes gully erosion. During high-intensity thunderstorms in summer and spring, infiltration excess overland flow tends to occur with a very substantial, fast contribution from the tile drainage system. During infiltration excess overland flow events, all forms of erosion from interrill to gully erosion may occur on the fields that are poorly covered by crops (such as bare soil after soil management), but sedimentation immediately occurs when the sediment laden water enters a field with better cover (such as wheat). During very dry periods in summer, the high clay contents will cause shrinking cracks which act as macropores for re-infiltration during subsequent events. In winter, rain-on-snow runoff may occur as saturation overland flow during large events leading to gully erosion. In fact, this is when most of the overland flow occurs during the year. However, the main runoff generation mechanism in winter is through lateral subsurface pathways (shallow sub- surface preferential flow paths, drainage pipes). Even minor events (of, say, 5 mm) will lead to a significant increase in streamflow due to high soil moisture during the winter. After freezing periods, when the soil is still frozen, infiltration excess overland flow may occur.', '3.1.2', '232', 'Catchment description', 1, '4', 'Vegetation types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 371, 94, 371, 1, 11, 2),

We explored this partition in a flat sedimentary dry catchment in central Argentina in which the replacement of native vegetation with rainfed crops was accompanied by the abrupt formation of groundwater-fed streams by subsurface erosion (i.e., sapping) episodes. Historical records indicated widespread water table rises (~0.3 m y−1 on average). Groundwater level and stream baseflow fluctuated seasonally with minima in the warm rainy season, indicating that evaporative discharge rather than rainfall shapes saturated flows. Diurnal groundwater level fluctuations showed that plant uptake was widespread where water tables are shallow (<3 m) but restricted to deep-rooted Prosopis forests where they are deep (7–10 m). MODIS and LANDSAT NDVI revealed a long-term greening for native vegetation, new wetlands included, but not for croplands, suggesting more limited evapotranspiration-groundwater level regulation under agriculture. Close to the deepest (20 m) and most active incisions, groundwater level and greenness declined and stream baseflow showed no seasonal fluctuations, hinting decoupling from evapotranspiration. Intense ecological and geomorphological transformations in this catchment exposed the interplay of five mechanisms governing evapotranspiration/streamflow partition including (a) unsaturated uptake and both (b) riparian and (c) distributed uptake from the saturated zone by plants, as well as (d) deepening incisions and (e) sediment deposits over riparian zones by streams.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The deep soil keeps the groundwater away from the surface, causing runoff to cease quickly after events. It may sound counterintuitive that water flow will cease in deep soils with higher storage capacity, however, at this scale we are mainly seeing water stored in the soil which is not necessarily coming from deep groundwater storage. Therefore, besides soil depth, flow permanence might be controlled by the interaction of topographic characteristics (e.g., slope and contribution area) and soil properties. Where the soil is shallow and steep, between W5 and W7, the water table emerges on the surface, fed by the deep and gentle soils upstream, maintaining the flow beyond the time scale of the event. The channel morphology must also be considered in the runoff generation. The intermittent channel has a well-defined channel bed and is mainly composed of sand. In the lower part of the slope, near the wells W11 and W10, the soil is also shallow and steep, but it is formed by boulders, which could increase the transmissivity of the soil and consequently increase the losses through infiltration.\nThe total precipitation threshold for the beginning of runoff is very low and almost any event can start the runoff in the slopes. The density of active drainage increases with total precipitation, but the places of origin of the flow can be highly variable. The fragmentation of the flowing network leads to a high density of active drainage, but a low density of connected drainage. The antecedent moisture control over the beginning of the hillslope-outlet connection is clear for events larger than 10 mm. If the antecedent moisture of the basin is high and it does not rain with enough maximum intensity to overcome the transmissivity of the soil, the connection will not be reached. When connectivity is established, it increases with increasing total precipitation. There is a limited flow capacity and the moisture threshold must be exceeded long enough for the process to have a significant impact, connecting the slope to the channels as it has been noticed in other studies [18,19]. During high-intensity events there may be an increase in runoff even though the soil moisture threshold has not been exceeded. For Class 4 events (>85 mm), total precipitation and intensity control drainage density and connectivity. The study basin shows a mixture of processes dependent on intensity and on moisture for establishing the connection of the slope by surface paths, something that has rarely been reported for humid catchments [18].\nVariations in flow distribution and flow travel time are largely controlled by the topography and infiltration capacity of the soil [27]. The high rate of soil infiltration and the low saturated hydraulic conductivity (Table 1) can provide soil saturation close to the surface, suggesting the occurrence of saturation-excess overland flow [3]. The direct relationship between the frequency of OFDs’ activation and the slope area [27] and the inverse relationship between frequency of OFDs’ activation and the concavity of the contribution areas [44] is an indication of fast flow, facilitated by the topographic characteristics despite the relationship being weak. The most active OFD was located where the contribution area changed the most. The difference in the frequency of activation of the sensors can be explained by the anisotropy of soil properties [45] and vegetation characteristics [43]. Soil structure and saturated hydraulic conductivity can be changed in areas with different vegetation stages [46], making some regions more conducive to flow generation [16].\nThe influence of vegetation has not been quantified; however, the high infiltration rates are the first indication that the structure of the forest has a significant role in the generation of runoff, mainly in processes that occur close to the surface.', '4', '11', 'Discussion', 2, '2', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'Slopes described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 373, 184, 373, 1, 3, 2),

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The primary loss component of the water balance is ET. The average annual ET rate for LRB has been quantified as 47% to 88% of annual rainfall (Bosch et al., 2004). Evapotranspiration was determined as the difference between annual rainfall and annual water loss. Annual water losses included annual streamflow and losses to regional groundwater. Losses to regional groundwater were assumed to be 1% of annual rainfall (Sheridan, 1997). In the LREW, streamflow is typically greater in the winter and early spring than during the summer and fall months (Sheridan, 1997; Shirmohammadi et al., 1986). Analyses of long-term hydrological trends have indicated that the winter and spring months typically have higher rainfall and lower ET (Bosch et al., 2017) which create greater soil moisture and aquifer recharge, increasing surface runoff responses and groundwater contributions to streamflow. In the LREW, direct surface runoff can vary between 5% and 40% of annual rainfall while shallow subsurface interflow can vary between 2% and 35% of annual rainfall (Asmussen & Ritchie, 1969; Bosch et al., 2012; Hubbard & Sheridan, 1983).\n\nBaseflow is particularly important in this region of rich surface and subsurface water resources that are essential for agriculture. In the LREW, baseflow was found to produce 53% of annual streamflow while stormflow was found to produce 47% (Bosch et al., 2017). In other Coastal Plain watersheds of similar size and having similar characteristics, baseflow ranging from 58% to 73% has been reported (Novak et al., 2003). Due to the highly variable transmissivity of the surficial aquifer, baseflow contributions to streamflow can be quite temporally variable. In the LREW, contributions of baseflow to streamflow have been found to vary seasonally as a function of varying ET levels and aquifer storage (Bosch et al., 2017). Baseflow was the greatest during the months from December through May (55%–57%) and the least during the months from June through November (43%–46%). Annual baseflow was found to decrease with increasing annual rainfall, indicating that during high rainfall years saturation excess driven stormflow increases in the LREW. Hydrograph analysis indicated an average stormflow duration of 7 days in the largest Little River Watershed (LRB, Figure 1), typically extended by interflow in this watershed (Bosch et al., 2017).\n\nWhile row-crops across the LREW play an important economic and environmental role, the LREW landscape is dominated by a dense dendritic network of stream channels bordered by riparian forest wetlands (Asmussen et al., 1979). Within LRB, 22% of the area is covered with upland forests while 28% is covered by riparian forests (Bosch et al., 2004, Bosch et al., 2006 LandSat data). These forested areas play a key role in the LREW hydrology and water quality. Evapotranspiration for the forested portion of the watershed is considered much larger than ET from the row-crops and pasture. Bosch et al. (2014) measured transpiration rates for a forested slash pine (P. elliottii Engelm.) riparian buffer and quantified the rates to be 1114 mm for the period from April to December, or 103% of potential ET.\n\n(4 Discussion) Surface water ponds throughout the watershed used to supply irrigation water are typically installed on first order streams. These ponds are frequently supplemented with groundwater from the deeper Floridan Aquifer. High volumes of irrigation would thus be expected to influence runoff by introducing inputs in addition to rainfall. While the fraction of irrigated land in LRN is greatest, this does not appear to have an impact on streamflow or Sratio in that watershed. Because most of the irrigation occurs during the summer period when ET is very high and landscape conditions are typically dry, the increased irrigation does not appear to impact streamflow at the levels of irrigated land observed here. [...] he water yield-drainage area relationship observed here is consistent with that of a drainage network that intercepts surface runoff and lateral subsurface flow from uplands and has low deep seepage losses [...] A slight decrease in water yield is observed as the watershed area increases (Figure 5) (trend not found significant, α = 0.05). Based upon the general trend obtained from the fitted line to the log–log plot, the water yield decreases from the smallest watershed studied here (LRM) to the largest studied (Alapaha) the water yield decreases from 390 to 274 mm. This decrease indicates increasing consumptive water use with increasing open water/wetland area in the region, attributed to increased ET that occurs with increasing relative open water and wetlands.', '1.2', '2', 'Hydrology and evapotranspiration', 2, '3', 'Vegetation types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 375, 124, 375, 8, 7, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'In the catchment Obere Brachtpe, essential and fundamental findings on the impact of topography and soil moisture on subsurface connectivity and runoff generation were also obtained. The analysis of temporally high-resolution groundwater data in relation to the discharge of the receiving stream during several rainfall/runoff events has shown the influence of slope form, and the flat riparian zone on the runoff processes (Chifflard, 2006). Due to the convergent slope form, subsurface stormflow is concentrated at the bottom of the convergent hillslope. Because of the small slope inclination in the flat riparian zone, the velocity of subsurface water flow is reduced, and groundwater from the slope is transported to the channel with a time lag. As a consequence of this delayed groundwater flow, the runoff in the receiving stream increases again following the initial peak. According to the findings of (Chifflard et al., 2010), delayed peaks are a fundamental indicator of the contribution of subsurface runoff.\n\nThe influence of the antecedent soil moisture on runoff generation was quantified by multiple regression analyses of rainfall, pre-event discharge, single-point soil moisture profiles from representative locations and peak discharge, discharge duration, discharge volume, based on 137 single rainfall-runoff events (Chifflard et al., 2018; Chifflard & Zepp, 2008). The evaluation of the extensive dataset shows that the number of explanatory variables in the regression models is lower in winter (up to three variables) than in summer (up to eight variables), and higher for the mesoscale catchment (Hüppcherhammer) than for the small catchment (Husten) (up to two variables). In addition, it was shown that soil moisture data from selected key sites (plot size) in the small catchment improved the quality of the regression models constructed for the mesoscale catchment. This indicates the varying importance of the soil moisture, depending on which characteristics of the discharge are focused on. Based on this intensive data evaluation, it can be concluded that point data for soil moisture in functional landscape elements describe the system condition of catchments very well, and can provide valuable information for flood forecasting in mountain landscapes with subsurface runoff.', '4', '4', 'Research Findings', 2, '2', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'Topography described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 376, 165, 377, 3, 1, 2),

These results emphasize the importance of cover beds in the generation of subsurface runoff and, additionally, in subsurface connectivity in a subdued relief. It has to be highlighted that the basal layer shows a temporally variable influence on soil-water fluxes, dependent on antecedent soil moisture, the latter being defined as initial soil moisture at the onset of a runoff event. On one hand, the basal layer functions as a barrier for vertical water flow when soil moisture is low; while on the other hand, it is a preferential pathway for lateral subsurface runoff in the case of high soil moisture. The temporal variability of subsurface connectivity between lower slope positions and the stream has been proven by the combination of tracer-hydrological (catchment scale) and hydrometric measurements (plot scale) during different rainfall/runoff events (Figure 3). This has shown that the intermediate and basal layers influence soil-water dynamics and runoff generation in different ways, depending on antecedent soil moisture (Chifflard et al., 2008; Moldenhauer et al., 2013).', '4', '4', 'Research Findings', 1, '2', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 377, 21, 377, 1, 5, 2),

The meadows also reacted a little less, but are still quite sensitive to antecedent soil moisture content during sprinkling experiments (Klebinder et al., 2014). Due to large annual precipitation, the probability of precipitation events to occur at high soil moisture contents is very high, as Gaál et al. (2012) stated for neighboured catchments in the Flysch zone. The fast runoff reaction of the Ruggbach to precipitation events is because of fast subsurface stormflow in shallow soils on forested slopes with a short connection to the receiving streams. High subsurface flow contributions from forested slopes, for example, by pipe flow, are reported by numerous authors (Ghestem, Sidle, & Stokes, 2011; Jost, Schume, Hage, Markart, & Kohl, 2012; Keppeler & Brown, 1998).

The southern part is in a glacial meltwater valley with glacio-fluvial sediments prevalent extending from Warsaw to Berlin (Figure 1b), where the catchment outlet discharges water into Lake Dehmsee and subsequently into the River Spree. The more elevated northern part of the catchment is dominated by freely draining unconsolidated ground moraines, with glacio-fluvial sands and gravels prevalent in the South. Soils are freely draining and have a high fraction of sand (Table 1), though the northerly soils associated with the ground moraine have a higher silt content and retain more water (Figure 1c). Near the stream and in depressions, peat deposits are extensive and remain close to saturation throughout the year. Kettle holes are abundant as depressions in the landscape and are strongly influenced by groundwater (Nitzsche et al., 2017). These small water bodies provide important habitats and ecosystem services (Biggs et al., 2017). The finer soils in the northern and eastern parts of the catchment are used for agricultural production (Table 1, Figure 1d). Multiple peatlands and fens exist along the stream network that are partly used as meadows. Land use gradually changes to forestry towards the southern region of the catchment (Figure 1d). Large parts of the catchment''s forest cover are dominated by stands of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) which were intensively managed in the past. More recent management aims to enhance mixed and broadleaved forests (Lasch et al., 2002). The catchment has been historically drained, and fields in wetter areas are widely underlain with tile drainages. There is no irrigation being applied for agriculture. The anthropogenically influenced stream network (Nützmann et al., 2011) is highly drought-sensitive (Kleine et al., 2020) with flows being intermittent during dry periods (Smith, Tetzlaff, Gelbrecht, et al., 2020). Drainage and the connection of glacial hollows which formerly had no surface outflow expanded the channel network from 20 km (1790) to 88 km (Nützmann et al., 2011). This results in a transformed hydrology, channel morphology, aquatic habitats, and nutrient cycling (Blann et al., 2009). Overall, streamflow generation in the catchment is dominated by groundwater; the catchment has a strong seasonal flow regime, with highest flows generally in winter. Runoff coefficients during storm events are <5% indicating limited contributions from restricted areas of saturated or compacted soils, as well as sealed (urban/road) surfaces (Smith, Tetzlaff, Gelbrecht, et al., 2020).', '2', 'N/A', 'Study Site', 1, '1', 'Vegetation types described', 'Soil described', 'Geological types described', 'Topography described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 381, 53, 381, 1, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The occurrence of subsurface stormflow in the Slapton Wood catchment was first noted by Troake and Walling (1973). They described one large runoff event where a second ‘delayed’ peak in stream discharge was observed several days after the ‘storm’ discharge peak (which coincided closely with the rainfall input). At the time, this type of response in the catchment was regarded as rare, but we now know that as many as 10 such double-peaked hydrographs can occur each winter (Burt & Butcher, 1985). The development of such double-peaked hydrographs shows that subsurface stormflow (or throughflow) is the dominant runoff process operating. Delayed subsurface stormflow may dominate the runoff response both volumetrically and in terms of peak discharge where deep permeable soils overlie impermeable bedrock and where steep valley-side slopes border a narrow valley floor (Anderson & Burt, 1990). In the Slapton catchments, the main bulk of the shale bedrock is totally impermeable but the soil and regolith, several metres deep, are very permeable allowing large volumes of subsurface stormflow to be produced quickly after rainfall. Hydraulic conductivities of up to 1 m per hour have been measured at the base of the soil profile (Burt & Butcher, 1985). Examining 44 hydrographs for the period 1969–1982, Burt and Butcher (1985) found that during the winter half of the year, these delayed hydrographs accounted for 46% of the runoff and occupied over half the time; by contrast, quickflow occupied only 2% of the time and contributed less than 4% of the runoff. A study of soil moisture distributions using an automatic tensiometer system showed that the generation of delayed hydrographs is associated with the formation of a ‘saturated wedge’ which builds up within the soil above the impermeable bedrock. During periods of high subsurface discharge, the saturated wedge extends up the major dry valleys to link with saturated zones on the plateau (Burt & Butcher, 1985).\n\nThe delayed hydrograph is an especially important time for nitrate leaching because both flow and concentration are high at the time. Figure 2 shows (a) stream discharge and (b) nitrate concentration in the Slapton Wood stream and for a throughflow trough at the base of the slope in the woodland. The throughflow has a lower concentration than the stream because much of the hillslope is wooded, although there is a field at the top from which some nitrate will leach into the subsurface flow (Burt & Arkell, 1987). The stream better reflects the catchment, which is largely agricultural, but both hydrographs attest to the importance of subsurface flow. Burt and Butcher (1985) mapped areas of soil saturation at the soil-bedrock interface in the Eastergrounds contributing area (see Figure 2), demonstrating a clear link between streamflow and subsurface stormflow draining from the plateau downslope to the stream network. During the quickflow response, the stream nitrate is significantly diluted by low-concentration overland flow from roads and paths; there is only a very little dilution effect for the throughflow. During the delayed response, the concentration of nitrate in the throughflow rises significantly, corresponding to the overall stream response. The delayed subsurface stormflow response, generated by the growth of the saturated wedge, is a time of significant nitrate leaching, with both discharge and concentration increasing. The nitrate leaching is associated with both infiltration through the soil profile and with the vertical growth of the saturated wedge upwards into surface soil horizons which have not been saturated since the last event of comparable size.', '2.1', '4', 'Hydrology and nitrate leaching', 1, '1', 'Vegetation types described', 'Soil hydraulic properties described', 'Bedrock described', 'Slopes described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 382, 215, 382, 1, 2, 2),

This results in a snowmelt-dominated hydrograph with an annual average streamflow of 6.5 m3/s at the transition between the mountain and valley portions of the watershed. Peak flows occur in the spring with low flows spanning summer through winter.\n\nThe headwaters are located on the Utah-Idaho border with little development in the upper, mountainous portion of the watershed. Land cover within the upper portion of the watershed is primarily characterized by forest and rangeland. The bedrock geology comprises primarily limestone and dolomite formations with karst topography marked with sinkholes and fractures that feed underground drainage systems that are intercepted by interbedded siliciclastic units (Bahr, 2016; Dover, 1995; Spangler, 2001). Three major karst springs (Ricks, Wood Camp Hollow, and DeWitt Springs) contribute significant flow directly to the Logan River throughout most of the year. Additional inflow to the river and its tributaries originates from numerous springs (both karst and non-karst) which may or may not flow year-round. DeWitt Springs serve as the primary drinking water source for nearby Logan City. Three perennial tributaries (Beaver Creek, Temple Fork Creek, and Right Hand Fork Creek) join the Logan River along with other intermittent tributaries in the upper portion of the watershed.\n\nIn contrast, the lower portion of the watershed is characterized by considerable anthropogenic influences. Before exiting Logan Canyon, a significant fraction of the Logan River is diverted into the Highline Canal during the May–October irrigation season. Upon entering the valley, the river cuts through layers of unconsolidated gravel, sand, silt, and clay deposits from the Provo, Alpine, and Bonneville stages of ancient Lake Bonneville (Dover, 1995). It flows on a bed of main-stream alluvium through the urban areas of Logan City, then westward through predominantly agricultural areas before merging with Cutler Reservoir. Along this path, two additional diversions (Crockett Canal and Young Ward Canal) again remove large fractions of the streamflow to supply Logan and surrounding communities with both urban and agricultural irrigation water. Two similarly anthropogenically influenced tributaries, Spring Creek and the Blacksmith Fork River, converge with the Logan River near the transition between the dominantly urban and dominantly agricultural portion of the watershed. The lowest flows occur during the summer irrigation period given the frequent and large diversions from the Logan River and its tributaries in the valley. In dry years, all remaining water is removed at the most downstream diversion, leaving a dry channel. However, within the lower portion of the watershed, there are also many unknown and ungaged inflows that help maintain some amount of flow in the Logan River during these periods.', '2', '1', 'LOGAN RIVER WATERSHED DESCRIPTION', 2, '1', 'Vegetation types described', 'N', 'Geological types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 383, 127, 383, 4, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', '1984 snowmelt runoff Peak snowmelt runoff occurred in stream B1 on April 15 at which time the premelt groundwater component is estimated at about 52% of the total flow. Prior to peak flow the groundwater component was greater than this and after peak flow the groundwater component was less, reaching a minimum of about 45% one week after peak flow. Rain during the major runoff period in April does not need to be considered as a component of runoff since the amount involved was insignificant (< 2%) relative to the amount of water stored in the snowpack prior to melting Provided the unsaturated zone is not frozen with ''concrete'' frost, melting of the snowpack will cause meltwater to infiltrate the subsurface and to recharge the zone of groundwater saturation. Continuous water-level measurements in piezometer Hl-l.8 m near stream B2 during a two-week period in April 1984 show a diurnal cycle in water-level fluctuations that are related to daytime melting of the snowpack and infiltration of the meltwater (Fig. 7). However, isotopic measurements of the groundwater at three depths in piezometer HI indicate that the meltwater itself penetrated to a depth of < 1.8 m, at least during the period of maximum runoff in mid-April (Fig. 8). The water-level fluctuations shown in Fig. 7 represent the pressure pulses generated by fluctuations in the overlying water table as meltwater infiltrated the shallow subsurface, displacing premelt subsurface water downward and laterally through the groundwater flow system. Infiltration of meltwater into the shallow subsurface and mixing with premelt water was observed at the hillslope piezometer HU- 0.7m (Fig. 8). Groundwater at this site on November 24, 1983, had an 180 of - 10.4%o, which represents the 180 of the very shallow subsurface water in the hillslopes following the autumn rains and prior to the onset of snowmelt. Meltwater infiltration near HU resulted in an 180 decrease of almost 7%o relative to the premelt hillslope groundwater 180 value. Compared to stream B1, stream B2 is relatively small in length and low in discharge and there is no isotopic evidence to indicate significant variations in the proportion of groundwater from the upper reaches of the stream to its mouth (Table 3). […] On July 14-15, 1984, we sampled a major summer storm runoff event in stream B1 using a rain-activated automatic sampler (ISCO). Approximately 41mm of rain having an 180 of -4.5%0 fell on the watershed, generating the runoff hydrograph shown in Fig. 16. The ~sO increased from a base-flow value of - 13.2%o to a maximum of - 10.5%0, and the pH depression was approximately 0.5pH units. At peak flow the pre-event component was about 70% of the total flow. Prior to and following peak flow the pre-event component was even larger. The conclusion that pre-event groundwater is the major source of storm runoff is entirely consistent with the large premelt components calculated during snowmelt runoff at B1. The results of this and other runoff studies using environmental isotopes enable us to arrive at some general conclusions regarding the mechanisms of runoff generation in humid, temperate regions of the Precambrian Shield. Since pre-event components of runoff are generally greater than 50%, saturated groundwater flow must be the major runoff-generating mechanism in these environments. Hortonion overland flow, partial-area overland flow (caused by surface saturation from below by a rapidly rising water table), and subsurface storm flow (interflow), are rejected as possible dominating runoff mechanisms since they all involve discharge of mainly event water to the stream during the runoff period. Recently, Gillham (1984) and Abdul and Gillham (1984) have shown through field and laboratory experiments that the addition of even a small amount of water to the capillary fringe (the zone of tension saturation) can cause a rapid and disproportionately large rise in the water table resulting in large discharges of groundwater to streams. This capillary-fringe effect may well be an important phenomenon capable of mobilizing groundwater to stream runoff in these Shield watersheds. […] Isotopic studies of the 1984 and 1985 snowmelt runoff periods in the Turkey Lakes watershed confirm the conclusions of earlier studies at this site (Bottomley et al., 1984) that groundwater of premelt origin is a major component of the stream runoff. In the two streams studied, 50-60% of the peak flow was contributed by groundwater recharged during the previous year or perhaps even earlier. This lag time between groundwater recharge and discharge enables the production of carbonate alkalinity below the water table through the dissolution of silicate and carbonate minerals by carbonic acid. In the shallow surficial deposits on the hillslopes, however, the rapid infiltration of the acidic 233 meltwater temporarily overwhelms the acid-neutralization capacity of these materials, resulting in shallow groundwater acidification events. Groundwater deeper than 1-2 m experiences increased hydraulic heads associated with meltwater recharge but is not influenced chemically by mixing with the meltwater during the runoff period.

The Adirondack region is almost entirely forested and is the largest state park in the United States. Repeated glaciations that last receded 10 000 years ago have left rugged terrain. Bedrock geology is a complex mixture of granitic and gneissic rocks with a variety of less common metasedimentary formations scattered throughout the region (Roy et al., 1997). Surficial deposits reflect this complexity and include highly weatherable calcareous minerals in some areas (Roy et al., 1997). Mean annual precipitation ranges from approximately 800 to over 1600 mm across the region (Ito, Mitchell, & Driscoll, 2002). Below-freezing temperatures occur through most of the winter, and with the onset of spring in late March or early April accumulated snow melts over several weeks causing high sustained streamflows.\n\nIn North Buck (area 27 ha), organic-rich soils directly overlie bedrock in all but the lowest area of the watershed where some thin till deposition has occurred. As a result, the stream is prone to becoming dry during periods in the late growing season (August–September). A wetland with a floating vegetation mat, 0.75 ha in area, occurs near the top of the watershed, adjacent to a forested area with moss-covered perennially wet soils covering an area of 0.25 ha. The forest is a mixture of hardwood and conifer species. The most abundant canopy tree is red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.), followed by red maple (Acer rubrum L.), beech, (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) and hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.). Coniferous litter contributes to a thick forest floor that averages greater than 21 cm (Oe plus Oa horizons). Soils and stream water are dominated by organic acidity that results in stream pH values that rarely exceed 4.5 (Lawrence, Scanga, & Sabo, 2020).\n\nIn South Buck (area 52 ha), till deposits play a larger hydrologic role, maintaining continuous flow even during extreme dry periods and providing acid neutralization that is well expressed during base flow. Beech is the most abundant overstory tree species, but sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.), and a few red spruce are also present in the canopy. Soils are less influenced by organic matter than North Buck but are also extremely acidic. The average forest floor thickness is less than 10 cm, which reflects hardwood litter that decomposes more readily than conifer litter.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The period November - April, the dormant vegetation season, produces 82 percent of the annual streamflow. A similar relationship was found on the Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia (Reinhart et al. 1963). The relatively shallow soils do not have a large water storage capacity, and recharge occurs quickly. This lack of soil water storage space produces ''flashy'' or rapid streamflow response on these watersheds. This minimal soil water storage dictates that baseflow cannot be sustained during prolonged dry periods and the streams cease flow for brief periods during the year. Low flows occur primarily in July and August, periods of low precipitation and high evapotranspiration demand. The longest period without flow was an 11 day span in late August and early September, 1975. \nA flow duration curve (figure 3), representing the 1972 - 1976 period, indicates the distribution of flows and further substantiates the flashy nature of streamflow from the area. Morisawa (1968) indicates that flow duration curves allow characterization of runoff from watersheds. Those watersheds with deep permeable soils and large water storage capacity will exhibit flat flow duration curves, whereas watersheds with little or no storage have steeply sloped curves. The curve from Falling Rock watershed has a relatively steep slope, further evidence of lack of moisture storage within the soils of Robin­son Forest.. \nStormflows \nStormflow or direct runoff from relatively undisturbed forested water­sheds consists primarily of subsurface flow, with little or no surface runoff in evidence.

If we assume that our streamflow measurements represent total water yield from the watershed, this 44 percent response is very high!

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Loch Vale Watershed (LVWS) is a 660 ha northeast-facing basin located in Rocky Mountain National Park about 80 km NW of Denver, Colorado (Figure 1). Since 1981, it has been the site of a long-term ecological monitoring and research program. The watershed ranges in elevation from 3110 m at the outlet of the lowest lake, The Loch, to 4010 m at the Continental Divide. More than 80% of the basin surface consists of bedrock outcrop and active talus slopes. Bedrock consists primarily of Precambrian-aged granitic gneiss and schist (Cole, 1977; Mast, 1989). Several permanent snowfields and an active rock glacier, remnants of neoglacial activity, occupy about 1% of the watershed. In areas of relatively gentle slope, the valley floor is covered with glacial till of Pinedale age (Mast, 1989). Forest soils have developed on the moraine veneer below 3300 m elevation, covering about 5% of the area of the catchment. Complete profile descriptions and chemical analyses can be found in Walthall (1985). Soil pH (1:1 paste) ranges between 3.7 and 4.8. Cation exchange capacity of these soils ranges from 50 to 100 ceq kg -l, but base saturations are quite low, with a mean of 23% in the organic surface layers and decreasing to below 10% in the deeper horizons. The exchange complex is dominated by Ca (Walthall, 1985; Baron and Walthall, 1985). Soil development is very heterogeneous, varying in depth from 1 to 50 cm. These soils support a mature forest of Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmanii) and subalpine fir (Abies Iasiocarpa), which covers about 6% of the total land area (Arthur, 1990). Alluvial and bog soils occupy only about 1% of the watershed, but have a disproportionate influence on surface water chemistry due to their position adjacent to stream channels. These highly organic soils are characterized by base saturations of less than 13% (Walthall, 1985). Accumulation of snowpack in LVWS begins in November of each year, and the melt begins in mid- to late-April. More than 75% of the annual water input to the basin is in the form of snow. Midwinter melting events are extremely rare, and snowpack temperatures remain below 0 °C above the ''depth hoar'' zone from about November through late March. Peak runoff occurs late May to early June, with 40 to 50% of annual runoff occurring by July 1 (Figure 2). Meltwater from the permanent snowfields contributes to stream discharge through August, and baseflow is maintained by groundwater seepage until early winter. From December through February there is no baseflow. The volume of The Loch is about 60 000 m 3, but during winter more than half of the total water volume of the lake freezes. The remaining water is confined to a narrow channel between the inlet and outlet, so at the beginning of snowmelt the lake is more appropriately treated as part of Icy Brook. Baron and Bricker (1987) documented major increases in solute concentrations under winter ice cover; these were attributed to the exclusion of dissolved ions from lake ice. […] Flowing water was first observed in 1987 at the Loch Outlet on March 13, following a period of unseasonably warm temperatures. Stream water was sampled from a hole excavated through the snowpack during March and part of April, but stream discharge remained too low to measure until April 22 (Figure 4a). […] Wind redistribution of the snow during the winter led to large differences in the depth of the snowpack, and differences in slope, aspect, and vegetative cover (shading) are likely to cause some areas to begin melting much earlier than other areas. The high-concentration early meltwater must have been flowing from some areas of the watershed even as later, more dilute water was being contributed from other areas. This spatial heterogeneity of meltwater production resulted in less acidic inputs to surface waters than would be expected if the entire snowpack ripened and released meltwater at the same time. […] Declining total ionic strength through the melt period in both years (Figure 6) further support the hypothesis that soil solution was flushed rapidly by infiltration of meltwater. A similar pattern was reported by Johanessen et al. (1980). These authors categorized the runoff into three phases: early piston flow, peak concentrations from snowpack solute release, and dilution. […] The relatively strong influence of forest soil drainage on stream composition at the beginning of the melt season is somewhat surprising given the small areal soil coverage of the watershed. Mast et al. (1990) have shown that on an annual basis, weathering of primary minerals in the bedrock of LVWS can explain nearly all of the flux of ions from the basin. We hypothesize that snowpack in the lowest (forested) parts of the watershed melts earliest, and that asynchronous melting causes surface waters to exhibit the characteristics of a forested catchment with welldeveloped soils in the early spring. Later in the season meltwater inputs from higher areas of the basin dominate, and solute chemistry reflects the predominantly alpine character of the watershed. By late spring the soil drainage component is difficult to detect.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'In the upland watersheds of Vermont the major portion of storm runoff seems to be produced as overland flow on small saturated areas close to streams. The remainder of the watershed acts mainly as a reservoir during storms, and between storms it supplies base flow and maintains the wet areas that produce storm flow. Runoff from these wet areas is supplied by water escaping from the ground surface to reach the channel as overland flow and by direct precipitation onto the saturated area, which is essentially an expanded stream system. The runoff process depends on the operation of several continuous, interdependent flow systems, which though difficult to separate in the field except by detailed experiment, have very different reactions to rainfall. The most important transition between flow systems seems to be at the soil surface, when water is released from the extreme damping effect of subsurface flow. The importance of an area as a source of storm runoff, therefore, depends on its ability to produce overland flow. The area contributing overland flow is dynamic in the sense that it may vary seasonally or throughout a storm. The fluctuations of this partial area can be rationally related to topography, soils, antecedent moisture, and rainfall characteristics. Different soils of a watershed contribute most of their storm runoff by the same process, but with differing frequencies. Thus, the channel areas below WC-1, the upper end of the channel area above WC-1, much of the seep B catchment, the central concave area of the trenched hillside, and the straight trenched slope can be viewed as potential contributing areas arranged along a scale of rainfall return period at intervals of approximately 10-2, 10-1, 10 0, 10 1 to 10 2, and 10 2 to 10 3 years, respectively. Hydrographs of overland flow from these small areas reflect the hyetograph in a manner analogous to those from urban source areas. Storage and translation within the main channel system of a basin converts the effects of these hydrographs into a more familiar attenuated form. The partial area concept provides an attractive alternative to the Horton and subsurface storm flow models as the basis for a study of storm runoff production in an area such as Vermont.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The last broad theme of the research agenda is related to runoff formation in the mountain environment. Although the mean transit time of streamflow in the catchment exceeds 1 year (Dóša, Holko, & Kostka, 2011; Holko, 1995; Holko & Kostka, 2006) runoff response to rainfall in the catchment is fast. The time lag between maximum precipitation and peakflow varies between 1.4 and 3.4 h (Kostka, 2009). Catchment runoff during the events is best correlated with rainfall amount and combined measured and simulated daily data indicated the existence of a threshold of about 40 mm of rain that has to fall after a longer rainless period before another runoff event occurs (Kostka & Holko, 2003). The pre-event water contribution is significant; its contribution to peakflow during a number of snowmelt and rain events was, only 3 out of 44 cases less than 70% (Holko, 2000; Holko, Bičárová, et al., 2018; Holko, Danko, Kostka, & Liová, 2013; Holko, Kostka, & Šanda, 2011; Holko & Lepistö, 1997). Runoff during the first snowmelt events is almost solely composed of the pre-event water and maximum contribution of snowmelt (event) water after a snow-rich winter is about 60% (Holko, Danko, Kostka, & Liová, 2013). The hydraulic conductivity of the topsoil is high enough to infiltrate almost all observed rains (Dóša et al., 2012; Dóša, Holko, Kostka, & Martincová, 2011). Fast water infiltration is enhanced by high macropore flow, especially in the forest soil. The contribution of macropores to total infiltration varied from 63% to almost 100% (Hlaváčiková et al., 2019). Measured overland flow was mostly below 10% even for high rainfall intensities (2.3, 3.8 and 4.9 mm.min−1; rain durations 15, 5 and 5 min, respectively) applied by the rain simulator (Holko, Danko, et al., 2018). Electrical resistivity tomography indicated a shallow subsurface lateral flow at a depth of 5–10 cm in the sandy-loam to clayey-loam soils of the catchment foreland developed on an impermeable bedrock (Kostka & Holko, 2017). The high skeleton content in stony mountain soils decreases water retention (Hlaváčiková et al., 2015). Measured catchment runoff hydrographs were similar to simulated soil water outflow hydrographs for about a half of rainfall events selected in the summer months 2013–2016 (Mujtaba et al., 2020).

Just 11% of the catchment is covered by Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris) forest to be found mostly on steeper hillslopes (Wang et al., 2017). Freely draining peaty podzols prevail on the upper and steeper hillslopes where heather dominates (Tetzlaff et al., 2014). Here, the GW table is often >1 m below the soil surface (Blumstock et al., 2016; Scheliga et al., 2018). The catchment interfluves and steeper hillslopes have been identified as the main areas for GW recharge. On the lower hillslopes and valley bottom, peats and peaty gley soils characterize the subsurface with shallower GW tables close (<0.3 m) to the ground surface (Blumstock et al., 2016). These wet conditions are sustained by subsidy from groundwater discharge on the lower slopes and the saturated peaty soils generate overland flow in storm events.\n\nThe response of the volumetric soil moisture content (VSMC) in the upper hillslope has been shown to have a more distinct drying and rewetting pattern between storm events compared to very conservative responses in the quasi-permanently saturated riparian zone and lower hillslopes (Tetzlaff et al., 2014). The hillslopes can contribute rapid storm run-off once they become hydrologically connected to the stream network, via the wetlands, during prolonged storm events (Soulsby et al., 2015).

Deciduous European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) forest and a small proportion of heathlands (Calluna vulgaris L. and gramineae) dominate the upper, steeper parts of the catchment (800 to 1600 m a.s.l.), whereas evergreen oak (Quercus ilex) forest dominates in the lower half of the catchment (400 to 1000 m a.s.l.).

The geomorphology of the streambed changes along the stream; at the upper parts of the catchment the streambed is composed by rocks and cobbles and wetted width is ca. 1.5 m, whereas sands and gravels predominate at the valley bottom, where wetted width is ca. 3.5 m. Monitoring of hydrological data at Font del Regàs, including stream discharge and groundwater levels, was previously limited to a few years in the early 2010s (see e.g., Lupon et al., 2018; Lupon, Bernal, et al., 2016).\n\nIn our sites, riparian soil moisture averages 40 to 50% at Font del Regàs, whereas it rarely exceeds 20% at Fuirosos (Butturini et al., 2002; Lupon, Sabater, et al., 2016). Moreover, riparian groundwater levels at Font del Regàs remain relatively stable throughout the year, indicating that a permanent saturated aquifer is connected even during summer (Lupon, Bernal, et al., 2016).

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The Fuirosos catchment, located in the Montnegre-Corredor Natural Park (outlet at 41°43’ N, 2°34′ E), includes a total drainage area of 16.5 km2 that ranges between 80 and 758 m a.s.l. (Figure 1). The seasonality of temperature and precipitation at Fuirosos is similar to that of Font del Regàs, but the overall climate is warmer and drier, typically semi-arid Mediterranean due to the high evapotranspiration in relation to the precipitation (Medici et al., 2008). During the period 2009–2019, average annual air temperature was 13.9 ± 0.5°C and average annual precipitation was 658 ± 216 mm year−1, as measured by a nearby meteorological station. Catchment forests are dominated by evergreen species, including cork oak (Quercus suber L.), Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis L.), and maritime pine (Pinus pinaster L.). Small proportions of deciduous forests are present in the upper parts of the catchment and include chestnut (Castanea sativa L.), hazel (Corylus avellana L.), and downy oak (Quercus pubescens L.). Lower parts of the stream channel are embedded in sandy alluvial deposits and flanked by a well-developed riparian zone, which is 10–20 m wide and consists mainly of plane tree (Platanus hispanica L.) and black alder (Bernal et al., 2005). Annual potential evapotranspiration for the overall catchment ranges between 975 and 1418 mm year−1, as estimated with the Penman-Monteith equation for different periods between 1999 and 2006 (Bernal et al., 2012; Medici et al., 2008). Upslope soils are poorly developed, with a thin organic O horizon, or more frequently an Ao horizon that transition into a B horizon at ca. 5 cm depth. Groundwater in the upslopes flows more than 2 m b.s.s. and percolates rapidly through the soil towards the stream by preferential flow paths (Butturini et al., 2003). The catchment is drained by an intermittent stream that exhibits an erratic flow regime (sensu Botter et al., 2013). No surface runoff is observed during the driest months of the year, typically from late June to late September (Bernal et al., 2002). The streambed is dominated by sand, rocks, and boulders and mean wetted width increases along the stream from 1.5 to 2.5 m during the months with observable surface runoff. Stream discharge and groundwater levels were previously monitored during the late 1990s and the 2000s (see Vázquez et al., 2013 and within references).\n\nIn our sites, riparian soil moisture averages 40 to 50% at Font del Regàs, whereas it rarely exceeds 20% at Fuirosos (Butturini et al., 2002; Lupon, Sabater, et al., 2016). [...] In contrast, riparian groundwater levels at Fuirosos experience large seasonal fluctuations and can drop down in the summer and remain disconnected from the stream for months (Butturini et al., 2003). Similar to other semi-arid catchments, previous modelling exercises identified two main groundwater storages at Fuirosos; (i) a perched, riparian shallow aquifer that has the potential to transfer water to the stream during the non-dry season, and (ii) a permanent, saturated deep aquifer located well below the streambed that is generally disconnected from the shallow aquifer and from the stream (Medici et al., 2008). These two groundwater storages are connected only during the wettest conditions. [...] The flow regime at Fuirosos consistently includes a full season without surface runoff and a characteristic non-linear hydrological behaviour during the transitions between wet and dry conditions (Medici et al., 2008).

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', '2.1 STORMFLOW ZONE Detailed water budgets indicate that -90% of active subsurface flow occurs through the 1- to 2-m-deep stormflow zone. Natural areas of the ORR are heavily vegetated, and the stormflow zone approximately corresponds to the root zone. Infiltration tests indicate that this zone is as much as 1000 times more permeable than the underlying vadose zone. During rain events, the stormflow zone partially or completely saturates then transmits water laterally to the surface-water system. When the stormflow zone becomes completely saturated, overland flow occurs. Where such excavations as waste trenches penetrate the stormflow zone, a commonly observed condition known as bathtubbing can occur in which the excavation fills with water. Between rain events, as the stormflow zone drains, flow rates decrease dramatically and flow becomes nearly vertical toward the underlying vadose zone. The transmissive capability of the stormflow zone is created primarily by root channels, worm holes, clay aggregation, fractures, etc., collectively referred to as large pores. Although highly transmissive, large pores comprise only --0.2%of the total void volume of the stormflow zone. Because most of the water mass resides within less transmissive small pores, advective-diffusive exchange between large and small pores substantially reduces contaminant migration rates relative to fluid velocities in large pores. \n2.2 VADOSE ZONE A vadose zone exists throughout the ORR except where the water table is at land surface, such as along perennial stream channels. The thickness of the vadose zone is greatest beneath ridges, and thins towards valley floors. Beneath ridges underlain by the Knox aquifer(Copper Ridge, Chestnut Ridge, McKinney Ridge, and Black Ridge), the vadose zone commonly is as much as 50 m thick, whereas beneath ridges underlain by the Rome Formation(Haw Ridge and Pine Ridge) the vadose zone is typically <20 m thick. In lowland areas near streams, a permanent vadose zone does not exist because the stormflow zone intersects the water table. The vadose zone consists of regolith composed mostly of clay and silt, most of which is derived from the weathering of bedrock materials, and which has significant water storage capacity. Most recharge through the vadose zone is episodic and occurs ''along discrete permeable features that may become saturated during rain events, even though surrounding micropores remain unsaturated and contain trapped air. During recharge events, flow paths in the vadose zone are complex, controlled by the orientation of structures of the materials, such as relict fractures. Between recharge events, flow rates decrease dramatically, and flow paths are toward the groundwater zone. \n2.3 GROUNDWATER ZONE A convergence of evidence indicates that most water in the groundwater zone of the aquitards is transmitted through a layer, -1-5 m thick, of closely spaced, connected fractures near the water table, zt, shown below. Many open fractures, which extend only a short distance into the rock, can be seen on outcrops, and the near correspondence of the water table with the top of weathered bedrock in the ORR is probably not coincidental. Regolith above this level has been formed by a large water flux, and the presence of unweathered bedrock at deeper levels apparently indicates a smaller water flux. Cyclic variations in water table elevation change the saturated thickness of the permeable layer. The resulting changes in transmissivity explain ... an order-of-magnitude fluctuation in groundwater discharge rates even though (1) contours of annual high and low water table elevations show little change in hydraulic gradient and '' (2) seasonal changes of water level in most wells are small compared with height of the water level above stream level. Opposite changes in hydraulic gradient and saturated thickness occur from one topographic location to another. The product of transmissivity and hydraulic gradient is constant (or increases with recharge) along each flow path. The range of seasonal fluctuations in depth to the water table and in rates of groundwater flow vary significantly across the reservation. In the areas of the Knox aquifer, seasonal fluctuations in water levels average 5 m and the specific discharge through the active groundwater zone is typically 9 m/year. In the aquitards of Bear Creek Valley, Melton Valley, East Fork Valley, and Bethel Valley, seasonal fluctuations in water levels average 1.5 m, and typical specific discharge is 5 m/year. .m As in the stormflow zone, the bulk of water mass in the water table interval resides within porous matrix blocks between fractures, and diffusive exchange between matrix and fractures reduces contaminant migration rates relative to fracture fluid velocities. For example, the leading edge of a geochemically nonreactive contaminant plume migrates along fractures at a typical rate of 1 m/d; however, the center of mass of a contaminant plume typically migrates at only 0.05 m/d. Below the water table interval, fracture control becomes dominant in flow path direction. The base of the water table interval corresponds to the zone of transition from regolith to bedrock. In the intermediate interval of the groundwater zone, groundwater movement occurs primarily in permeable fractures that are poorly connected in three dimensions. In the Knox aquifer a few hydrologically dominant cavity systems control groundwater movement in this zone, but in the aquitards the bulk of flow is through fractures, along which permeability may be increased by weathering. One fracture set is parallel to and along bedding planes and thus parallel to strike. The dip of this fracture set varies with bedding plane dip, generally ranging between 10 and 50°. A second set is also parallel to strike but perpendicular to bedding planes. The dip of this set also varies with bedding plane dip and thus is a function of depth, inclined near the surface where bedding planes dip more steeply, then vertical at depth where bedding plane dip flattens. A third set is perpendicular to strike. Fracture orientations and converging groundwater flow paths in and near valley floors give rise to preferential groundwater movement along strike, toward cross-cutting tributary drainage ways. Bedding-plane and strike-parallel fractures and their intersections are more permeable than the dip-parallel fractures, and flow paths are along-valley toward crosscutting tributary streams. The chemical characteristics of groundwater change from a mixed-cation-HCO3 water type to an Na-HCO3 type in the ORR aquitards at depths ranging from 30 to 50 m. Although the geochemical mechanism responsible for this change in water types is not entirely quantified, it probably is related to water residence time. The transition from Ca-HCO3 to Na-HCO3 serves as a useful marker and is used in this report to distinguish the intermediate groundwater interval from the deep interval, a transition which is not marked by a distinct change in rock properties. Below the intermediate interval, small quantities of water are transmitted through discrete fractures in the deep interval. The hydrologically active fractures in tile deep interval are significantly fewer in number and shorter in length than in the other intervals, and the spacing is greater, partly because of less dissolution of fracture fillings. Fracture orientations are similar to those described earlier for the water table interval. Wells finished in the deep interval of the ORR aquitards typically yield <0.1 L/min and thus have no potential for water supply. The specific storage of the bedrock aquitard is small, as a result some hydraulic heads in the deep interval respond to precipitation events, even though the associated water flux is small. The chemical characteristics of groundwater in the deep interval are different from those of the water table interval and probably reflect longer water residence times. Although diffusive transfer between fractures and matrix blocks is an important process in the deep interval, the total matrix porosity is less than that of the water table interval, the vadose zone, or the stormflow zone, thereby reducing the retarding effect on contaminant migration rates relative to more shallow zones. \n', '2', '2-1', 'Overview of the conceptual model', 1, '1', 'N', 'N', 'Geological types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 394, 164, 394, 1, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'In the Kuparuk, as snow melts in the spring, frozen ground limits soil water storage and enhances water runoff to the river network (figure 2(B)). With the snowmelt comes large pulses of water that is rich in dissolved and particulate organic matter (DOM and POM, respectively) and associated nutrients, which are in turn exported downstream [49], resulting in increased aquatic productivity [28] (figures 2(C), (F)). The relatively short snowmelt occurs over several days to weeks and represents ∼35% of export in the Kuparuk River [68]. The significance of the spring snowmelt period has been shown in other Arctic rivers, representing between 20%–70% of annual carbon exports [50, 69, 70]. The spring snowmelt typically generates highly bioavailable DOM in the river network, which reflects the recent origin of the DOM from fresh litter and surficial soil horizons leaching with little previous decomposition [65] or photo-processing on the landscape or in the river [71–73]. Simultaneously, frozen soil restricts the flow of water to organic horizons during snowmelt, introducing dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) into adjacent river networks [74–76]. A portion of the DON may remain on site or be transformed into inorganic forms that can increase nutrient availability for terrestrial plants and soil microorganisms while some of the DON is exported downstream before mineralization to dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) [77] (figure 2(C)).\nAs thaw progresses in the Kuparuk, biological activity and deepening water flow paths increasingly control the amount of DOM and nitrogen as DON or DIN reaching the river network and leaving it via downstream export [46] (figure 2(C)). The seasonal thickening of the active layer facilitates the movement of water through deeper mineral soil profiles where it interacts with solute-rich permafrost [16, 74, 78] (figure 2(E)). These deeper flowpaths either promote DOM leaching from detritus and above-ground plant biomass as water builds up at the soil-permafrost interface, or increase rates of decomposition and increase sorption to mineral particles [24, 79]. Newly released DOM and DIN are then exported laterally by surface or subsurface flow paths [53], potentially decreasing soil nutrient availability and altering the chemical composition of waters draining permafrost landscapes [65, 74] (figure 2(C)). As inorganic nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) become increasingly limiting as a result of biotic demand, mobilized DOM continues to fuel instream respiration [29, 80, 81]. While low temperatures experienced in the early flow season may limit carbon processing by bacterial respiration, once DOM enters into the stream channel and is moved along the aquatic continuum, it can still experience high rates of processing via photo-mineralization and some partial photo-oxidation as it is transported downstream [71, 72] (figure 2(D)). Photo-oxidation requires sunlight to reach the water column, so its influence on DOM peaks in June and decreases later in the flow season, while hillslope connectivity is still increasing via active layer thickening until late flow season [79] (figure 2(E)). Concurrently, in the late flow season, DON may be sorbed to sediment particles or mineralized to DIN, resulting in increasing lateral flux of inorganic forms of nitrogen, such as NO3− [16, 75, 77]. While late-season DOM often exhibits low bioavailability [82], the decline of photo-processing and influx in DIN may result in a brief increase of late-season heterotrophic response [77] (figure 2(G)).', '1.1', '2', 'What we know: seasonality of biogeochemical budgets in the Kuparuk headwaters', 1, '3', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 395, 241, 395, 1, 1, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The main contribution to the Nsimi streamflow is through the hillside bedrock aquifer, which represents 65% of the total flow at the outlet. The groundwater that emerges at specific seepage points and springs is conveyed over the ground with little interaction with the swamp. The second contribution is from overland flow on the swamp surface during storm events, which contributes to about 31% of the streamflow. The groundwater flow from the swamp aquifer contributes only about 4% of the streamflow. During low flow conditions, the contribution of the hillside aquifer to the stream highly dominates the contribution of the swamp aquifer. During the storms, the relative contribution of overland flow increases according to the rainfall intensity and the initial saturation rate of the pre-event water reservoirs. The overland flow on the swamp chemically corresponds to the throughfall end-member as rainfall water content is modified by its percolation through the forest canopy. It appears that the relationship between the swamp and the stream fluctuates with space and time. While the swamp is drained by the stream most of the time, at the end of the long dry season, indirect recharge occurs from the stream to the swamp with a hydraulic gradient inversion in the swamp aquifer after the first rains. Evapotranspiration is higher on the hillside than in the swamp. Recharge on the swamp being very low, these results suggest that, except for a few storms at the end of the dry season, the Nsimi swamp does not contribute to flood attenuation.', 'N/A', '2259', 'Conclusion', 1, '1', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 396, 162, 396, 1, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'A multidisciplinary approach consisting of chloride mass balance technique coupled with water table fluctuations study and groundwater flow analytical modelling leads to a rigorous estimate of direct, localised (Rd,l = 45 mm/yr) and indirect recharge (Ri = 30 mm/yr) rates to groundwater in a forested watershed. Complementary geophysical measurements and hydraulic tests respectively confirm and explain the dissymmetry of recharge around the stream axis. The low values of recharge and runoff rates imply a very high evapotranspiration rate (about 87% of annual rainfall) from the deciduous forest cover in such a humid watershed, where evapotranspiration is controlled by both water availability and atmospheric demand.\nThe water yield of the watershed is low with an average of 180 mm/yr (105 mm/yr as runoff and 75 mm/yr as recharge) and its increase with the rainfall increase is reduced by the water demand from the forest. The impact of the forest on water yield (based on empirical worldwide curves) ranges between 210 and 340 mm/yr according to the rainfall rate.\nThe forest can impact the rate of recharge of percolating water to the water table. When deep tree roots are present, they can abstract water from the unsaturated zone during the transpiration process. In the case of Mule Hole, the resulting low recharge rate leads to a low water table which is disconnected from the surface stream. Therefore, the stream is highly ephemeral. While flowing, the stream infiltrates to the ground and indirect recharge takes place several dozen days per year. In the absence of groundwater flow to the stream, the total recharge to groundwater flows as outflow under the outlet of the watershed. This implies that vegetation abstraction has modified the groundwater basin, which is now different from the surface watershed. It results in groundwater flow below the weir which contributes for more than 90% of the main chemical outputs, and for less than 10% through surface runoff. As a consequence, the forest can impact both the hydrological cycle and the chemical balance of the watershed.', 'N/A', '99', 'Conclusion', 1, '1', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 397, 153, 397, 1, 2, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Meteoric waters are intercepted by vegetation and impervious areas. Surface runoff from the road and other impervious areas is transferred quickly to the sewer network or to the closest stream. Combined sewer overflows can release sewer network waters during heavy rain events. In rural and forested areas, rainwater infiltrates through the saprolite layer. When the catchment is dry, the saprolite layer is not saturated, and water can infiltrated further down to fill the upper part of the gneiss formation, which is highly fractured and permeable. This permeability, albeit spatially variable, allows the water to flow downhill and to join the streamwater at the valley bottom. This fractured gneiss groundwater is thus considered as the main contribution to the stream when the catchment is dry. In contrast, when the catchment is wet, the saprolite layer becomes saturated in water, resulting in the generation of a saprolite water flow and acting as an additional contribution to stream flow. We made the following assumptions on biogeochemical signatures based on this perceptual model. At low flow, the fractured gneiss groundwater forms the unique contribution to the upper streams (the Mercier stream and the upper Ratier stream before the confluence); the biogeochemical signature of the upper streams is expected to be representative of the fractured gneiss groundwater. At high flow, the saprolite water flowing through the saprolite layer act as the major contributor to the stream water; the biogeochemical signature of the upper streams is expected to be representative of the saprolite water. Perennial groundwater storage is found in the eastern colluvium deposits that continuously supplies the Ratier stream, downstream of the catchment. At the outlet of the Ratier catchment, both the fractured gneiss groundwater and colluvium groundwater are contributing to the total runoff. However, when the upper streams are dry, only the colluvium aquifer supplies the Ratier stream; so the stream water composition is expected to be representative of the colluvium aquifer groundwater. In this study, as no sampling campaign was done during raining events, direct surface runoff could not be considered.', '2.3.1', '5', 'Assumptions on the main runoff-generating sources: Perceptual model', 5, '2', 'N', 'N', 'Geological types described', 'N', 'N', 'N', 'N', 398, 182, 398, 13, 5, 2),
('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The basin is underlain by Ordovician greywacke, mudstone, and grits partially covered by soliflucted drift (Figure 1). Surface materials range from ranker, through peaty gleyed podzols to peat. [...] This implies that the piping approximately doubles the area contributing storm runoff in the basin, since pipeflow supplies half the runoff entering the stream. Pipes tap an additional 6 ha of the basin in the average storm,adding 1790 m3 of stormflow. Most of this additional 6 ha ofcontributing area is more distant from the stream than other sources of streamflow,since very little long distance overland flow has been observed here. The area of wet flushes or seepage zones abutting the stream is estimated on the basis of vegetation to be slightly larger than the remaining 6 ha which contribute to the stream during an average storm. This leaves a further 11 ha of slopes, mainly between and beyond the pipe networks which do not contribute stormflow. Figure 2 offers a schematic partitioning of the basin with the ‘riparian seepage contributing area’ representing all the non-pipeflow processes contributing to the stream, both seepage and overland flow. [...] Start and peak lag times therefore invert between ephemeral and perennial pipes. The ‘ready primed’ system of the perennial pipes, which derives pipeflow from groundwater and surface water bogs, begins to respond to rainfall before the ephemeral pipe system, where more rain is likely to be lost to soil moisture storage at the start of the storm. Start times are more delayed in the ephemeral pipes despite the fact that the ephemeral pipes typically run beneath only 150 mm of peaty overburden whereas the perennials flow beneath 500 mm of the same material.

('\N', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'The research area showed to be very inhomogeneous with respect to soil moisture. Samples showed large variations, i.e. from completely saturated to almost dry soils within distances of only centimeters. The saturated area also varied strongly with time. [...] The saturated area varied according to season, during and between the events of precipitation. Large variations appeared at different discharge. But for most cases a consistent correlation between saturated area and discharge seemed to exist. During flood conditions, the saturated area expanded to the sides and along hill­ slopes until it reached a maximum area, mainly defined by the particular precipita­tion event (dependent of the intensity and duration), the soil characteristics and the initial soil moisture conditions. In addition, new areas of saturation appeared. However, repeated registrations showed the saturated area to be almost the same during equal discharge for cases of recession. [...] The importance of saturated overland flow increases with the amount of the storm­ flow, because the saturated area increases with the discharge (see Fig. 3). The surface water on the saturated area (inclusive the stream) mixes with the rainfall on the area in the first part of a precipitation event. The surface water consists mainly of throughflow and groundwater that have arrived at the surface as return flow. This water mixes with the pure overland flow, increases in speed and contributes to the stormflow just in the start of the flood case. After this pulse, the return flow contributes with a larger part of total runoff as the rainfall decreases. The return flow may consist of throughflow and new groundwater (eventually also pipeflow) that return to the surface after having moved a relatively short distance in the upper soil levels. In a catchment as inhomogeneous as this, with moraine, stratification and rootsystems, it is likely that some water movements exist below the surface representing the scale from throughflow to piping. During the field observations, water disappearing in the ground and then reappearing on the sur­face a few metres down the slope was seen. An example of this may be seen from Fig. 3, where the upstream part of the stream disappears below the path crossing the catchment. The water from this part of the stream is seen to reappear further down the slope, - how far down depends on the discharge. Pipeflow may also cause that saturated areas which have no surface connection with the stream contribute to the storm runoff, supposing there is an underground connection to the stream along pipes (McCaig 1983, Jones 1979). As the saturated area decreases and the contribution from the throughflow to the return flow diminishes, the fraction of the runoff due to the groundwater increases.
